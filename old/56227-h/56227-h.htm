<h3>
<i>Preface</i>
</h3>

<p>
<i>The Royal Crescent&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Open we here on a Spring day fine...</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>the first scene of this Bath
Comedy.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The precise year, however, may not be given.
A sufficient reason for reticence in the matter
of exact date will be found in the unfortunate
predicament of the then Bishop of Bath and
Wells: undoubtedly a most mortifying episode in
the life of an invariably dignified Divine.  Now
there were several Bishops of Bath and Wells
during the second half of the 18th century,
and this trifling lack of circumstantiality will
do away with the least trace of scandal.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The second half of the century, however,
is admitted.  The fact, indeed, would be
revealed at once to the curious in the matter,
by the mention, on the one hand, of the King's
Circus (which dates from the last years of
second George), and on the other by the
reference to Bathwick Meadows as a solitary
site and still fitted at the time to an honourable
meeting, whereas it has been known as a place
of popular resort (under the name of Sydney
Gardens) since the year 1795.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A few other points, again (should anyone
think worth his while to consider so trifling a
question), might serve to fix within a few
lustres the date of Mrs. Kitty Bellairs' cantrips
as they affected, among other things, Lady
Standish's domestic happiness, Mr. O'Hara's
connubial hopes, and my Lord Verney's
sentimental education.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>It may be noticed, for instance, that the
gentlemen wear their swords.  That was, as
most people know, a distinction strenuously denied
them so long as the immortal Master of
Ceremonies, Mr. Richard Nash, reigned as King
of Bath.  Now, his autocratic rule came to
an end before George the Third was King.
As another landmark it will be recalled that
the notorious and indecorous encounter between
Richard Brinsley Sheridan and that unpleasant
personage, Captain Matthews, was the last
duel with swords fought in the Kingdom: and
it was fought in 1772.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Furthermore, our Captain Spicer (whether
veraciously or not) claims to have been a
favoured pupil of the famous Angelo&mdash;and
such a perfecting course in the noble art could
not have been acquired before the early sixties.
Then, again, there is still a good deal of powder
in our actors' head-dress.  The slippers of our
actresses are still delicious and high-heeled: the
sandal of the nineties has not yet made its
dreadful appearance.  And the ladies visard,
if not so universal as it once had been, is still
an accepted institution.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>It will suffice, in short, to say of our
characters (if once more we may be allowed to
paraphrase some of Mr. Austin Dobson's dainty
verses) that</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>They lived in that past Georgian day,<br />
  When men were less inclined to say<br />
  That "Time is Gold" and overlay<br />
  With toil their pleasure....</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>Those were, on the whole, rather more joyous
times than our own, and more different than
the mere lapse of one century seems to account
for.  The gentlemen then, dressed almost as
handsomely, prinked and plumed themselves as
elaborately, as the ladies.  Gallantry in both
senses and ready wit were their most precious
claim: a fight was considered a full remedy
to a slight, a sharp epigram to an injury.
Heavy drinking was held an indispensable
accompaniment to good-fellowship; and
love-making was a far suppler art than seems
known to this more earnest century&mdash;a pastime
for "the quality," something on par with the
gambling passion.  "Virtue" not modesty,
was woman's fair fame.  A forcible abduction
would at a pinch be argued as an undeniable
compliment.  Life ran like a dance then, with
merry, tapping heels and light-hearted
interchange of partner: those old-world days were
much younger than ours.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>So much for the times, and for the characters.
For scenery we have this gem among
prosperous towns.  The grey stone city of
wealthy, sedate residences, arranged with noble
architectural effect in broad straight streets,
wide open squares, parades, terraces, crescents;
tier upon tier on the slope of a hill down to
the water's edge; set serenely in a wooded
valley, with much green in perspective beyond
the lazy, slowly winding Avon.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Indeed, of its kind, Bath is unique among the
cities of Europe: deprived as it is, by modern
conditions, of its former social attractions, it is
still one of the most beautiful.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Like so many very old towns, it has had a
long Roman existence; its luxurious baths and
other remains testify to its splendour when it
was known as Aquae Solis.  It filled, also,
an important place in the land as a Mediaeval
Borough, wall-girt and defensible: of that
period the Abbey Church, the "Lantern of
England" remains a handsome bequest.  But,
on the surface at least, there is now nothing
to recall vividly any older past than the days
of periwig, of powder and patches, of "wine
and walnut" wit.  Its characteristic charm,
one which, happily, the present age has had
little power to efface, is par excellence that of
the 18th Century; for it was in early and middle
Georgian years that, with a strange suddenness
"The Bath" became an accepted centre of
fashion and pleasure, and assumed its special
physiognomy of leisure, wealth and exclusiveness.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>This old-world air still hangs about the
residential part of the Town and in a singularly
haunting way.  In those broad streets, calm
and silent and almost deserted at most hours,
in those high-windowed houses, typical of
stateliness and cold elegance rather than of lolling
comfort, the very atmosphere seems to this
day redolent of "Chippendale" notions.  The
sordidly plain modern dress of man is painfully
incongruous.  The rattling cab is a discord.
It would be a relief, much more than an
astonishment, to note an obvious three-cornered
hat, a broad-skirted coat, on one's fellow man,
to hear on the flags the regular tramp of
Chairmen swinging along some dainty charge
deliciously powdered and rouged!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The course of an hundred and odd years
has obliterated some scenes, and modified all
to some extent.  Orange Grove has lost, 'tis
true, much of its discreet character; and its
neighbouring chocolate rooms, so handy to
intrigues, are now only memories.  The Assembly
Rooms are shorn of all fashion.  The new
Great Pump Room is not quite a replica of
the old, though it has retained its general
air&mdash;but the Crescents, Royal and Lansdowne,
the Circus, Gay Street and Queen Square, the
Parades, and the flags of Abbey Place, are
still for us.  At certain hours, if we have
the mood, we can readily people them again
in our mind's eye with notable guests of "The
Bath" in its great days....  Dr. Johnson
and my Lord Chesterfield, Pops, Oliver
Goldsmith, Sheridan, Smollett, Chatham,
Gainsborough, Fanny Burney, according to the fleeting
thought&mdash;all "faithfuls of the Spa"&mdash;Greatness,
Literature, Art, mere Fashion&mdash;or, again,
shall we say Squire Bramble, or Lydia
Languish, or Sir Anthony Absolute; or blushing,
too ingenuous Evelina...?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Why, the place is alive with suggestion!
Here a house front, with its carved stone
wreaths and urns and bosses, with its pedimented
windows or its shell-canopied door (still provided
with its long since honorary link-extinguisher) if
you look at it enquiringly, seems ready to tell
its tale of by-gone life.  But, unlike that of
so many buildings of a past age, the tale of a
house in Bath rarely takes the earnest romantic
turn: it is irresistibly a "Comedy," comedy of
intrigue and manners, of fashion and all its
consequent frivolity (with perhaps just a little
pathos, but never beyond the limits of elegance)
Comedie à la Française mostly.  Je trompe, tu
trompes, nous trompons...!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>In this guise the first stately building at
the western extremity of the Royal Crescent,
its pilasters, its stone steps, curvetting
iron-work, clamoured to tell of Lady Standish's
so nearly disastrous experiment on her husband's
credulity.  The corner house of Gay Street near
George Street (opposite the alluring old-book
store of Mr. Meehan&mdash;the genial Bath
Antiquary) proclaimed at all the pores of its
crumbling stones, as clearly as if the
commemorative tablet had duly been erected, that
the warm-hearted Irishman, the Honble. Denis
O'Hara, had dwelt there in the year 17&mdash;.
There is another house, at the southern corner
of Queen Square, adorned with Cupid's heads
and cornucopiae, which beyond all manner of
doubt in that same year was the "lodging"
(Fashion spoke of lodgings then!) of the
ingenious young widow Bellairs.  In the same
manner the middle building, facing west, of
Pierrepont's Street, one of the most correct in
Bath, has still all the conscious air of having
sheltered once that most excellent young man,
Lord Verney.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>One of the drawbacks of setting down a
comedy in narrative form is the necessary
curtailing of all descriptive passages and
explanatory ethical disquisitions: in such a frame,
pen and ink pictures of scenery, and the
rendering of atmosphere, are out of place.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Let it therefore be borne in mind that, in
this Butterfly Drama, with the exception of
the penultimate scene enacted at the Inn in
Devizes, the scenery is altogether cast in or
about the handsome old grey town; in its
lofty-ceiled, polished-floored rooms, rather bare; on
its broad pavement, clean and trim and as
little crowded as any conventional stage.  Of
the rest it must be understood that we are in
the midst of what has been extolled as "the
Bath manner" and that throughout, as was
said of another, but world-wide known, Bath
Comedy,</i>

<h3>
SCENE I
</h3>

<p>
"What?  My sweet Lady Standish in tears!"
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty Bellairs poised her dainty
person on one foot and cast a mocking,
somewhat contemptuous, yet good-humoured glance
at the slim length of sobbing womanhood
prone on the gilt-legged, satin-cushioned sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Tears," said Mistress Kitty, twirling round
on her heel to look at the set of her new
sacque in the mirror and admire its delicate
flowered folds, as they caught the shafts of
spring sunshine that pierced into the long dim
room from the narrow street.  "Tears, my
dear, unless you cry becomingly, which I
would have you know not one in the thousand
can, are a luxury every self-respecting
woman ought to deny herself.  Now I," said
Mistress Kitty, and tweaked at a powdered
curl and turned her head like a bird for a last
glimpse at the mirror before sinking into an
arm-chair and drawing closer to her afflicted
friend, "have not shed a tear since I lost my
first lover, and that is&mdash;I will not say how
many years ago.  I was a mightily precocious
child!  When I say a tear, mind you, 'tis a
figure of speech.  Far be it from me to deny
the charm of a pearly drop&mdash;just one: enough
to gather on the tip of the finger, enough just
to suffuse the pathetic eye.  Oh, that is not
only permissible, 'tis to be cultivated.  But
such weeping as yours&mdash;sobs that shake you,
tears that drench the handkerchief, redden the
eyes, not to speak of the nose&mdash;fie! fie! it is
clean against all reason.  Come!" with a
sudden gentle change of tone, putting her
hand on the abased head, where fair curls
luxuriated in all their native sunshine, "what
is it all about?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish slowly and languidly drew
herself into a sitting posture, and raised a
countenance marred out of its delicate beauty
by the violent passion of her grief.  Swimming
blue eyes she fixed upon the Mistress Kitty's
plump dimpling face.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" she breathed upon the gust of a
sigh that was as wet as an April breeze, and
tripped up by a belated sob.  "Alas! you see
in me the most miserable of women.  Alas! my
heart is broken!"
</p>

<p>
Here the kerchief, soaked indeed beyond all
possible utility, was frantically held to streaming
eyes once more.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" cried the pretty widow, "you
could not take on worse if you had the
smallpox: you a three-months' wife!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah me!" moaned Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"So," said Mistress Kitty, "he has been a
brute again, has he?  Come, Julia, weep on
my bosom.  What is it now?  Did he kiss
you on the forehead instead of on the lips?
Or did he say: 'Zounds, madam!' when you
upset a dish of tea over his waistcoat?  Or
yet did he, could he, the monster!&mdash;nay it is
not possible, yet men are so&mdash;could he have
whispered that Lady Caroline looked&mdash;passable
last night?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish rose to her feet, crumpled
her kerchief in one small hand and faced her
friend with tragic passion.
</p>

<p>
"It is useless to blind myself," she said.
"Cease to gibe at me, pray, Mistress Bellairs;
I must face the truth!  My husband loves
me no longer.  Oh!  Kitty, Kitty," dropping
from her height of tragedy very quickly and
landing on a whimper again, "is it not sad?
I have tried, Heaven is my witness, to win
him back by the tenderest love, by the most
pitiful pleading.  He has seen me weep and
pine.  'Rob me of your love,' I have told
him, 'and you rob me of life.'  And he, he&mdash;oh,
how shall I tell you!  As the days go by
he is with me less and less.  He walks
abroad with others.  His evenings he gives
to strangers&mdash;ay, and half his nights&mdash;while
I may sob myself to sleep at home.  I saw
him to-day but for two minutes&mdash;'twas half
an hour ago.  He entered here upon me,
looking, ah Kitty! as only he can look, the
most elegant and beautiful of men.  I was
singing, piping as a poor bird may to strive
and call its mate to the nest.  He passed
through the room without a word, without a
sign; he that used to say 'twas heaven to sit
and listen to my voice.  'What!' I exclaimed
as he reached the door, 'not a word for poor
Julia?'  Kitty, at the sound of that cry, wrung
from my heart, he turned and frowned, and
said&mdash;&mdash;  (Oh, oh, oh.)"
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried Mistress Kitty, "what said
he?" ("Heaven help him," said she aside;
"the woman's a fountain.")
</p>

<p>
"He said," sobbed Julia, "'Mayn't a man
even go for a stroll?'  Oh, had you but heard
the cold indifferent tone, you would have
understood how it cut me to the heart.  I ran to
him and laid my hand upon his sleeve, and
he said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Again grief overcame her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what said he?"
</p>

<p>
"He said&mdash;oh, oh&mdash;he said, 'Julia don't paw me.'"
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty Bellairs, the reigning toast of
Bath, the prettiest woman, in the estimation of
her admirers, in all England, and the wittiest,
laughed low to herself, then rose from her chair,
took her tall friend by the shoulders, and
walked her up to the mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Look at yourself," said she, "and look at me."
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish winced.  The contrast
between her own dishevelled hair, her marbled
swollen countenance, her untidy morning gown,
and the blooming perfection of the apparition
beside her, was more than she could
contemplate.  Kitty Bellairs&mdash;as complete in every
detail of beauty as a carnation&mdash;smiled upon
herself sweetly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said she, "I have had thirty-seven
<i>declared</i> adorers these three years, and
never one tired of me yet.  Poor Bellairs,"
she said with a light sigh, "he had two wives
before me, and he was sixty-nine when he died,
but he told me with his last breath that 'twas I
gave him all the joy he ever knew."
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish ceased weeping as suddenly
as if her tears had been mechanically turned
off.  She regarded the widow earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, child," said Mistress Bellairs, with all
the authority of her twenty-six years, "here we
have been four weeks acquainted, and you have
more than once done me the honour of saying
that you considered me your friend."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis so," said Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"Then listen to me.  There are three great
rules to be observed in our dealings with men.
The first rule comprises an extraordinary
number of minor details, but briefly and
comprehensively it runs thus: <i>Never be monotonous</i>!
Second rule: <i>Never let a man be too sure of
you</i>!  Oh that is a wonderful wise maxim:
reflect upon it.  Third: <i>Never, never let a
man see how&mdash;well, how far from lovely
you can look</i>!  Tush, tush, you are a
better-looking woman than I am, but not when you
have been blubbering and not when you are
fretful."
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish suddenly sat down as if
her limbs could support her no more.  She
looked up at the ceiling with tear-dimmed
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Pray," said Mistress Kitty inquisitorially <i>ex
cathedra</i>, "how many times a day do you tell
that unfortunate man that you love him?  And,
worse still, how many times a day do you want
him to say that he loves you?  I vow 'tis
enough to drive him to cards, or wine, or
something infinitely worse that also begins
with a w!  And, pray, if you spend all you
have, and empty your purse, do you think
your purse becomes a very valuable possession?
'Tis a mere bit of leather.  Nay, nay, keep
your gold, and give it out piece by piece,
and do not give it at all unless you get good
change for it.  Oh," cried Kitty, a fine flush
of indignation rising scarlet behind her rouge,
"I marvel that women should be such fools!&mdash;to
act the handmaid where they should ever
rule as mistress; to cast forth unsought what
they should dole out only to the supplicant
on bended knee.  Hath a man ever had from
<i>me</i> an unsolicited avowal?  Have I ever
thrown the most ardent lover more than a
'perhaps' and 'it may be,' a smile, a dimple,
a finger-tip?  (What they have stolen I have
not given, that is obvious!  And, besides, 'tis
neither here nor there.)  And pray, Lady
Standish, since when have you left off putting
on rouge and having your hair tired and
powdered, and wearing a decent gown of
mornings and a modish sacque, and a heel
to that pretty foot, a jewel in the ear and a
patch beneath the lip?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish had ceased contemplating the
ceiling; she was looking at her friend.
</p>

<p>
"But, madam," she said, "this is strange
advice.  Would you have me coquette with
my husband, as if&mdash;God forgive me for even
saying such a thing&mdash;as if I were not wife,
but mistress?"
</p>

<p>
"La, you there," said Mistress Bellairs, and
clapped her hands, "there is the whole murder
out!  You are the man's lawful, honest wife,
and therefore all tedium and homeliness, all
fretful brow and tearful eye.  God save
us! who shall blame him if he seek a pleasant
glint of vice to change him of you?"
</p>

<p>
There fell a silence.  Lady Standish rose
indignant, grew red, grew pale, caught a
glimpse of herself again in the mirror, shrank
from the sight, and crept back to the sofa
with a humble and convicted air.  Then she
cast a look of anguished pleading at Mistress
Bellairs's bright unfeeling countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," she said with a parched lip,
"what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Do!" cried the widow, rising with a brisk
laugh, "get some powder into your hair, and
some colour into those cheeks!  And when
Sir Jasper returns (he left you in tears, he
will be sullen when he comes home; 'tis a
mere matter of self-defence) let him find you
gay, <i>distraite</i>; say a sharp thing or two if
you can; tell him you do not need his
company this afternoon.  Ah, and if you could
make him jealous!  'Tis a very, very old
trick, but then, you see, love is a very old
game, the oldest of all.  Make him jealous,
my dear, make him jealous and you'll win the
rubber yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Jealous!" cried the three-months' wife, and
all the blood of the innocent country girl leapt
to her brow.  "Oh, madam, how could that be?"
</p>

<p>
"Look out a beau, nay, two or three, 'tis
safer!  Talk discreetly with them in the
Pump-Room, let them fan you at the ball, let them
meet you in Orange-Grove.  Or, if you have
not spirit enough&mdash;and indeed, my sweet life,
you sadly lack spirit&mdash;start but an imaginary
one, merely for the use of your lord and master:
I wager you he will rise to the fly."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid Sir Jasper could be <i>very</i>
jealous," said the other uneasily.  "I
remember before we were wed, when my cousin
Harry would ride with me to the meet, oh,
how angry Sir Jasper was!  He swore he
would shoot himself, ay, and he was all for
shooting Harry too."
</p>

<p>
"But he was not the less ardent with you on
the score of it, I'll warrant him," said the
experienced Mistress Bellairs.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no," said Lady Standish, and her lip
trembled over a smile, while the ready water
sprang to her eyelashes, and: "Ah, no!" she
said again.  "Indeed, he loved me then very
ardently."
</p>

<p>
"And he'll love you so still if you have but a
spark of courage.  Get you to your room," said
the widow, goodhumouredly, "bustle up and
play your part.  Where is that woman of yours?"
</p>

<p>
She pushed Lady Standish before her as she
spoke, herself rang the call-bell for the
tire-woman, and gave a few pregnant suggestions
to that worthy, who advanced all sour smiles
and disapproving dips.  Then she strolled back
into the drawing-room and paused a moment as
she slipped on her long gloves.  Next she drew
a letter from her pocket and began to read it
with a thoughtful brow.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Sir Jasper," she said half aloud,
"you're a fine gentleman, and a pretty fellow,
you have a neat leg, and an eloquent turn of
speech, but I will not have the child's heart
broken for the amusement of an idle day."
</p>

<p>
She took the letter between each little forefinger
and thumb as if to tear it, thought better
of it, folded it again and thrust it back into its
place of concealment.
</p>

<p>
Presently she smiled to herself, and walked
out of the long open window across the little
strip of garden, and so through the iron gate
into the shady back street.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
SCENE II
</h3>

<p>
Sir Jasper Standish halted on the flags of the
Royal Crescent in front of his own door and his
face darkened.  He took a pinch of snuff.
</p>

<p>
"Now!  I shall find my lady in tears.  What
a strange world it is!  The girl you woo is as
merry as a May day: the wife you wed is like
naught but early November.  Equinoctial gales
and water enough to drown the best spirits that
ever were stilled.  'Tis a damp life," said Sir
Jasper, "and a depressing."
</p>

<p>
He sighed as the door was thrown open by
the footman, and crossed the hall into the
morning-room, where he had left his lady
weeping.  He beheld a flowered brocade, a very
shapely back, and a crisp powdered head
outlined against the window, and thought he had
come upon a visitor unawares.
</p>

<p>
"I crave ten thousand pardons," quoth he,
and swept from his gallant head his knowing
three-cornered hat.  But slowly the figure at
the window turned and he saw his wife's eyes
strangely brilliant over two pink cheeks, beneath
the snow of her up-piled hair.
</p>

<p>
"Julia!" said he in amaze, and stared and
stared again.  ("And did I doubt my own
taste?" thought he to himself.  "Why, she is
the prettiest woman in Bath!")  "Expecting
visitors, Julia?"  He smiled as he spoke: in
another minute that arm, shining pearl-like from
the hanging lace of her sleeve, would be round
his neck, and those lips (how red they were,
and what a curve!) would be upon his.  Well,
a loving woman had her uses.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lady Standish to his query.  She
dropped the word with a faintly scornful smile,
and a dimple came and went at the corner of
her lip.  There was a patch just above the
dimple.  Then she turned away and looked
forth into the still, solemn, grey and green
Crescent as before.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper stood bewildered.  Then he put
his hat upon a table and came up to his wife
and placed his arm round her waist.
</p>

<p>
"My sweet life," said he, "your gown is vastly becoming."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper," said Lady Standish, "you do
me proud."  She slipped from his embrace,
sketched a curtesy, and moved to the next
window.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper passed his hand across his brow.
That was Julia, Julia his wife, sure enough;
and yet, faith, it was a woman he did not know!
</p>

<p>
"You are mightily interested in the Crescent,"
said he, with some humour.
</p>

<p>
My lady shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you were vexed with me this
morning, love," said he.
</p>

<p>
"I, vexed?" said she.  "Nay, why should
I be vexed?" and then she tapped her foot and
looked at the clock.  "These servants grow
monstrous unpunctual," she said; "are we
not to dine to-day?"
</p>

<p>
He glanced down at the tapping shoe, its
little pointing toe and curving heel.  'Twas a
smart shoe, and boasted a diamond buckle in a
knot of rose-coloured ribbon.
</p>

<p>
"Egad!" said he, "I doubt if there is
another foot in Bath that could slip into that
case."
</p>

<p>
And Sir Jasper was a connoisseur!  His
opinion of himself, his faith in his own
discrimination (which had waned sadly these last
days) began to rise again, not disagreeably.
He smirked.  My Lady Standish, who, after
a way that only women can practise, seemed
absorbed in the contemplation of the empty
Crescent the while she was intent upon each
shade of expression upon her husband's countenance,
felt a sudden glow of confidence in her
own powers that she had never known before.
The game she had started with a beating heart
and a dry throat began to have a certain charm
of its own.  Was it so easy really?  Was a
man so lightly swayed?  There was contempt
in the thought, and yet pleasure.  Was all a
woman's loving heart to count for so little, and
a pretty gown, a new shoe, a coquettish manner
for so much?  Ah, there was bitterness in
that!  But yet the immediate result of this new
method: that look in his eye, that softening
of his lip, it was too sweet to be forborne.
Kitty was right!
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper took her hand.
</p>

<p>
"It wants," said he, "full half-an-hour to
dinner-time, love.  Nay, do not draw your hand
away.  You are vexed with me?  I left you
weeping, 'twas unkind."
</p>

<p>
"Weeping?" said Julia, and her heart fluttered
to her throat, so that she could hardly speak,
and Kitty's maxims kept dancing before her
eyes as if written in letters of fire.  "Make him
jealous&mdash;oh, if you make him jealous you will
win the rubber yet!"
</p>

<p>
"If I wept," said she, "must my tears have
been for you?"
</p>

<p>
"How now?" said Sir Jasper, and dropped
the little hand that struggled so gently yet
determinedly to be free.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear me," said Lady Standish, "how
droll you men are!"  She shrugged her
shoulders and laughed affectedly.  Like all
budding actresses she over-did the part.  But
Sir Jasper was too much stirred, too much
bewildered to be critical.  Moreover his armour
was not without vulnerable joints, and with a
wanton word she had found one at the first
pass.
</p>

<p>
"How now?" said he.  "Madam, and what
might that mean?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish trilled the bar of a song, and
again directed her attention to the view.
</p>

<p>
"Julia," said her husband in a deep voice.
"Julia," he repeated with a threatening growl
of passion.
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" she said, and tilted her little head.
</p>

<p>
"Who then were your tears for, if they were
not for me?  What signify these manners?
What do these insinuations mean?  By Jupiter,
I will have the truth!"  His face flushed, the
veins on his temples swelled, his nostrils became
dilated.
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish lifted the hanging lace of
her sleeve with one hand and examined it
minutely.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather," she said, and her voice
shook, "I would rather you did not question
me, Sir Jasper."  Then she flashed upon him
in anger, swift and lovely, as he had never seen
her flash before.  "You go your own way free
enough," she said.  "These last three weeks
you have not spent one evening in my company,
and half your days are given to others of whom
I know nothing, Oh, I am not complaining,
sir!  I did complain, but that is over.  I was
wrong, for I see adversities have their
advantages."  Here she smiled.  (Had the man but
known how near she was to tears!)  "Your
neglect leaves me free."
</p>

<p>
"Free!" cried Sir Jasper, and choked.
"Free!  Good heavens, free!  What in the
name of God do you mean?  Free, madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper," said Lady Standish, looking at
him very earnestly, "you will never hear me
ask again whose society it is you find so much
more attractive than your wife's."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," cried Sir Jasper, and hesitated
upon a gust of anger, at a loss in which
direction to drive it forth.
</p>

<p>
"No," said my lady, "and I expect the same
good taste from you.  'Tis not too much to ask.
Indeed you should rejoice if I have found
consolation for your absence."
</p>

<p>
He broke out with a fearful oath, and almost
leaped upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Consolation!"  He plunged his hands into
his powdered hair, and quivered into silence for
the very impotence of words.
</p>

<p>
"I said 'if,'" said she.  She was surprised
to find how readily the words came to her; and
yet her hands were clammy with fright, and her
breath ran short between her rouged lips.
"Let us leave it at the 'if.'"
</p>

<p>
She turned to the window and leant against
it, drew her kerchief and fanned herself.
</p>

<p>
Passing along the railings opposite the Crescent,
not twelve yards distant, a tall, slender
young gentleman of attractive appearance,
though very dark in complexion, caught sight
of her lovely glowing face, stared first in
unconscious admiration, then with recognition,
and finally, blushing swarthily, saluted with
some appearance of agitation.  Lady Standish,
aware that her husband had approached close
behind her, and hearing in every creak of his
satin coat the flattering emotion of his senses,
felt herself driven more and more by the
unknown demon of mischief that had taken
possession of her.  She fluttered her little
handkerchief back at the young gentleman with
a gesture that almost indicated the wafting of a
kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Death and damnation," cried Sir Jasper,
"before my very eyes!"
</p>

<p>
He seized her by the wrist and flung her
down upon the settee.  "Nay," he cried,
"there may be husbands that would put up
with this, but I am not of them.  So that is
the Consoler!  That is the Beau for whom
you prink yourself with such fine feathers,
whom you lie in wait for at the window to
make signals to and smirk at!  Oh, my
innocent country daisy!  Faugh!  I might
have known you were too fond&mdash;hypocrite!"  He
dashed at the window and burst its
fastenings.
</p>

<p>
"Hey! you, you my Lord Verney, a word
with you!"  Sir Jasper was already foaming
at the mouth.
</p>

<p>
The slim gentleman paused, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, heavens!" cried Lady Standish, "what
have I done?  Sir Jasper! my husband!"  She
threw herself upon him.  "Sir Jasper, what
do you suspect?  Oh, heavens!"  She was
half fainting and scarce could articulate a
coherent word.  "It was all to tease you.  It
was but the sport of an idle moment.  Oh, I
implore you, believe me, believe me!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, deny!" cried he.  "Deny what I have
seen with my own eyes!  Let me go, madam."  He
thrust her aside, and, bareheaded, dashed
down the stairs and out of the house towards
Lord Verney, who, with a bashful, yet a
pleasant smile, began to retrace his steps.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a fair day, Sir Jasper," said he
courteously, and then became aware of Sir
Jasper's convulsed face, and noted that Lady
Standish, whom but a moment before he had
beheld all smiling beauty, now clung despairingly
to the window-post, her countenance
ghastly behind her rouge.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney was a shy young man.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;ah, good morning," said he, bowed
politely, and turned with celerity.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper flung a look of infinite derision
and contempt towards his wife.
</p>

<p>
"You have chosen," it seemed to say, "a
pretty hare!"  Then he arrested the slim swift
figure with an aggressive shout:
</p>

<p>
"Stand&mdash;stand, Lord Verney&mdash;Lord
Verney&mdash;a word with you."
</p>

<p>
The youth stopped, wheeled round, and:
</p>

<p>
"I am at your service," said he.  A certain
pallor had replaced the ingenuous young
blushes upon his cheek, but into his eye there
sprang a fine spark of spirit.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper marched upon him and only
halted when his six feet of sinewy bulk
were within a yard of the stripling's willowy
shape.  His hot red-brown eyes shot fire and
fury, death and annihilation upon the innocent
young peer.  His full lips endeavoured to
sneer, but rage distorted them to a grimace
through which his white teeth shone forth
ferociously.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, we understand each other,"
said he; "will you walk with me?  There
is no time like the present and a couple of
friends are easy to come by."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis vastly well," said Lord Verney with
an attempt at dignity that betrayed the boy
in every line of him.  Then all at once colour
flushed into his face again, and his rigid
demeanour was broken up.  "Come, devil take
it all, Sir Jasper," said he, "and what is it
about?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper threw bloodshot eyes upwards.
</p>

<p>
"This fellow," quoth he, appealing to
Heaven&mdash;"oh! this pretty fellow!  You want
reasons, my Lord Verney?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney blushed and stammered.  Gad,
he'd like to know what he had done.  He
was at Sir Jasper's disposition, of course, but
before drawing swords on a man&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper uttered a sound which was between
a groan and a roar.  He indicated with
sweeping gesture the figure of Lady Standish
strained in anguish watching, clinging still to
the window-post.  Then he hissed:
</p>

<p>
"I know!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper!"
</p>

<p>
"I know, I tell you," repeated Sir Jasper,
"let that suffice."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens," gasped Lord Verney, "here
is some most grievous mistake.  Do you mean,
sir&mdash;am I to understand, Sir Jasper&mdash;?  'Tis
monstrous."  White dismay and crimson
confusion chased each other across his candid
brow.  "Surely you do not mean me to understand
that Lady Standish has any connection
with this extraordinary scene?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper's trembling hand was furiously
uplifted, then blindly sought his sword hilt,
and then dropped in impotent disgust at his
side.
</p>

<p>
"My lord," said he, "Lady Standish is the
pearl of womanhood, I would have you know
it!  There never breathed a female more
virtuously attached to her husband and her
duty&mdash;I would have you know it!"  His face
was quite horrible to look at in its withering
sarcasm.  "My quarrel with you, sir, is&mdash;"  He
paused and cast a roving eye upon the
young gentleman, who now began to show
unequivocal signs of fear.  A jealous husband,
a contingency that may have to be met any
day&mdash;but a raving maniac! ...
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the shape of your leg that mispleases
me, sir.  You have a vile calf, I cannot
endure that so offensive an outline should pass
and repass my windows."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, Sir Jasper, yes, yes," said
Lord Verney soothingly, backing as he spoke
and casting nervous eyes round the empty
street.  "And so, good-morning."
</p>

<p>
He bowed and turned.
</p>

<p>
"Rat!" cried Sir Jasper, and shot forth a
clutching hand.
</p>

<p>
"I will bear it in mind," cried Lord Verney.
"Good-morning, good-morning!"
</p>

<p>
He was fleeing away on a swift foot.
</p>

<p>
"Rat!  Rat!" screamed the enraged baronet,
starting in pursuit.  But his passion made him
clumsy.  He stumbled, lurched, struck his foot
against a stone, fell upon his knee and rose
in another mood: one of darkling sullen
determination for revenge.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney was a timid young man.  Had
it been with anyone else that this scene in
the Royal Crescent had taken place all Bath
would have known within the hour that Sir
Jasper Standish had been seized with sudden
lunacy.  But Lord Verney was of those who
turn a word over three times before they
speak and then say something else.  Moreover,
he was not sure that he himself had cut
a brilliant figure in the amazing duologue, so
he held his tongue upon it.
</p>

<p>
As the day grew, however, he began to
have a curious recollection of Lady Standish's
lovely smiling greeting and of that little
gesture with the white handkerchief, which
had almost seemed like the blowing of a kiss
(here his very ears would grow hot), then of
Sir Jasper's inexplicable wrath, and of the
stricken figure by the window!  Could it be?
Twas impossible!  Nay, but such things had
been.  When the dusk fell he made up his
mind and sought the counsels of that fashionable
friend who was kind enough to pilot his
inexperience through the first shoals and rocks
of Bath life.  This genetleman's name was
Spicer.  He called himself Captain: of what
regiment no one knew.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
SCENE III
</h3>

<p>
Sir Jasper came striding back to the house.
In the morning-room he passed his wife
without a word.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper," quoth she, and shot out a
timid hand.  "Oh, Sir Jasper, will you not
listen to me?  This is the most terrible
mistake.  Sir Jasper, I swear I am true to you,
not only in deed but in every inmost thought."
</p>

<p>
"Do not swear, madam," said he, and shut
the door in her face.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later he sallied forth again.
She heard his steps ring out: they sounded
very desperate.  She sat on the pink-striped
settee in a misery too deep this time for tears.
How puerile, how far away, seemed the morning's
storm.  She sat with her hands locked
and her eyes starting, revolving terrible
possibilities, and fruitless plans for preventing them.
Dinner was served in vain.  Her ladyship's
woman brought her a dish of tea.  This poor
Julia drank, for she felt faint and weary.
Then a sudden thought struck her.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Mistress Bellairs who made the mischief,"
she thought, "now she must mend it."  She
dashed off a despairing note to the lady
and dispatched her black page with all possible
celerity.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"I have followed your advice, to my undoing.  You
told me to make Sir Jasper jealous; I tried to make him
jealous, and succeeded far too well.  He fancies there is
something between me and Lord Verney.  Poor young
man, I have spoken to him but three times in my life!
There will be a duel and they will both be killed.  Come
to me, dear Mistress Bellairs, and see what is to be done,
for I am half dead with fear and anguish."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The dusk was falling when, with incredible
celerity, the sedan-chair of Mistress Bellairs
rounded the corner at a swinging pace; her
bell-like voice might be heard from within
rating the chairmen with no gentle tone for
their sluggishness.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis snails ye are&mdash;snails, not men.  La! is
there one of you that is not a great-grandfather?
It is not, I would have you know, a
coffin that you are carrying, but a chair.  Oh,
Gad, deliver me from such lazy scoundrels!"
</p>

<p>
In a storm she burst open the door; in a
whirlwind tore through the passage.  Lady
Standish's obsequious footmen she flounced
upon one side.  Into that afflicted lady's
presence she burst with undiminished vigour.
</p>

<p>
"So," said she, "these are fine goings on!
And why Lord Verney, may I inquire?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mistress Bellairs," ejaculated her friend,
with a wail, "'tis indeed terrible.  Think of Sir
Jasper's danger, and all because of my folly in
listening to your pernicious advice."
</p>

<p>
"My advice!" cried Mistress Kitty.  "My
advice&mdash;this is pretty hearing!  Here, where is
that woman of yours, and where are those
stuffed owls you keep in the hall.  What is the
use of them if they do not do their business?
Light up, light up&mdash;who can speak in the
dark?"  She ran from one door to another
calling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," sighed Lady Standish, and leant
her distraught head against the cushions.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," cried Mistress Bellairs, heedless
of the presence of footmen with tapers, and
lady's-maid with twinkling curl paper.  "Sit
up this minute, Julia, and tell me the whole
from the beginning.  It is no use your trying
to extenuate, for I will know all that has
happened."
</p>

<p>
But before her friend, whose back was beginning
to stiffen under this treatment, had had
time to collect her thoughts sufficiently for a
dignified reply, Mistress Kitty herself proceeded
with great volubility:
</p>

<p>
"And so, madam, not content with having a
new young husband of your own, you must fix
upon Lord Verney for your manoeuvres.  Why,
he has never so much as blinked the same side
of the room as you.  Why, it was but yester-night
he vowed he hardly knew if you were tall
or short.  Put that out of your head, my Lady
Standish, Lord Verney is not for you.  Oh,
these country girls!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish rose, quivering with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Be silent, madam," she said, "your words
have neither sense nor truth.  I was ill-advised
enough to listen to your unwomanly counsels.
I tried to deceive my husband, and God has
punished me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Mrs. Kitty, "deceit is a very
grievous sin.  I wonder at you, that you must
fix upon Lord Verney.  Oh, Julia!" here her
voice grew melting and her large brown eyes
suffused.  "You had all Bath," she said, "and
you must fix upon Lord Verney.  The one man
I thought ... the one man I could have....
Oh, how did you dare?  Nay!  It is a blind,"
she cried, flaming again into indignation and
catching her friend by the wrist.  "There was
more in your game than you pretend, you sly
and silken hypocrite!  If he is killed, how will
you feel then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," exclaimed Lady Standish, "cruel
woman!  Is this your help?  Sir Jasper killed!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper?  Sir Fiddle!" cried Mistress
Kitty, with a fine scorn.  "Who cares for Sir
Jasper?  'Tis my Harry I think of.  Oh, oh!"
cried the widow, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish stood confounded.
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried she, "<i>you</i> love Lord Verney?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the only man of them," sobbed Kitty,
"who does not pester me with his devotion&mdash;the
only one who does not come to my call like
a lap-dog.  If I look at him he blushes for
bashfulness, and not for love; if his hand shakes
it is because he is so sweetly timid, not because
my touch thrills him.  I had set my heart,"
said Mistress Kitty through her clenched
teeth&mdash;"I had set my heart upon Lord Verney, and
now you must needs have him ki&mdash;ki&mdash;killed
before I have even had time to make him see
the colour of my eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh!" sighed Julia Standish, still beyond tears.
</p>

<p>
And:
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" sobbed Kitty Bellairs, quite forgetful
of red noses and swollen lids.
</p>

<p>
There was a silence broken only by the sobs
of the widow and the sighs of the wife.
</p>

<p>
Then said Mistress Kitty, in a small, strangled
voice: "Let this be a lesson to you never to
deceive."
</p>

<p>
"I never told a single lie before," moaned
Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Kitty, "there never was a single
lie, madam.  A lie is wed as soon as born, and
its progeny exceeds that of Abraham."
</p>

<p>
The two women rose from their despairing
postures, and, mutually pushed by the same
impulse, approached each other.
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done now?" said Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done?" said Mistress Bellairs.
</p>

<p>
"Let us seek Sir Jasper," said his wife, "and
tell him the whole truth."
</p>

<p>
Kitty, through wet eyelashes, shot a glance
of withering scorn upon her friend.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," she said sarcastically, "that would be
useful truly.  Why, child, let you and me but go
and swear your innocence to Sir Jasper, and
it will be enough to establish you steeped in
guilt in the eyes of every sensible person for
the rest of your life.  No," said she, "better
must be thought of than that.  We must act
midwife to the lie and start the little family
as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"I will lie no more," said Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"I am told," said Mistress Kitty musingly,
"that Lord Verney has learned swordsmanship
abroad."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cruel!" moaned the other.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty paused, bit a taper finger,
scratched an arch eyebrow, drew white brows
together, pondered deeply.  Suddenly her
dimples peeped again.
</p>

<p>
"I have it!" said she.  "'Tis as easy as
can be.  Will you leave it to me?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish began to tremble.  She had
wept much, she had not eaten, her heart was
full of terror.  Faintness she felt creep upon
her.
</p>

<p>
"What will you do?" she said, grasping
after the vanishing powers of reflection with
all her failing strength.
</p>

<p>
"Do?" said Mistress Bellairs.  "First of
all, prevent the duel.  Will that serve you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," cried Julia, and grew livid
behind her paint.
</p>

<p>
"She has got the vapours again," thought
the other.  "What a poor weak fool it is!"
</p>

<p>
But these vapours came in handy to her
plans; she was not keen to restore Lady
Standish too promptly.  She called her woman,
however, and helped her to convey the sufferer
to her room and lay her on the couch; then
she advised <i>sal volatile</i> and sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it all to me," she murmured into the
little ear uppermost upon the pillow; "I will
save you."
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish groped for her friend's hand
with her own that was cold and shaking.  The
ladies exchanged a clasp of confidence, and
Mistress Bellairs tripped down to the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said she to herself, "let us see."  Sudden
inspiration sparkled in her eye.  She
plunged her hand into the depth of the brocade
pocket dangling at her side, drew forth sundry
letters, and began to select with pursed lips.
There was Sir Jasper's own.  Those gallant
well-turned lines, that might mean all or
nothing, as a woman might choose to take
them&mdash;that was of no use for the present.
Back it went into the brocade pocket.  There
was a scrawl from Harry Verney declining her
invitation to a breakfast party because he had
promised (with two "m's") my Lord Scroop
to shoot (with a "u" and an "e").  Kitty
Bellairs looked at it very tenderly, folded it
with a loving touch, and replaced it in its nest.
Here was a large folded sheet, unaddressed,
filled inside with bold black writing.  A crisp
auburn curl was fastened across the sheet by
an emerald-headed pin.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"Most cruel, most beautiful, most kind!"
</p>

<p class="noindent">
ran the ardent lines,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"most desired, most beloved!  Was it last night or a
hundred years ago that we met?  This is the lock of hair
the loveliest hand in all the world deigned to caress.  It
became upon that moment far too precious a thing for its
poor owner.  He ventures, therefore, to offer it at the shrine
of the goddess who consecrated it.  Will she cast it from
her?  Or will she keep it and let it speak to her, every
hair a tongue, of the burning flame of love that she has
kindled in this mortal breast?  Did I dream, or can it be
true?&mdash;there was a patch above the dimple at the corner
of your lip.  I kissed it.  Oh, it must have been a dream!
One word, fairest:&mdash;When may I dream again?
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Your own and ever your own.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"P.S.&mdash;The lock was white before you touched it, but
you see you have turned it to fire!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty read and smiled.  "The very
thing!" Then she paused.  "But has the
woman a dimple?" said she.  "Has she?
Never mind, something must be risked.  Now,
if I know men, Sir Jasper will spend the whole
night prowling about, trying to discover
confirmation of his suspicions."
</p>

<p>
The letter was folded up.  "It must seem
as if it dropped from my lady's bosom.  Here,
at the foot of the sofa, just peeping from
behind the foot-stool!  A jealous eye cannot
miss it!"
</p>

<p>
The deed was done.
</p>

<p>
She caught up her cloak and hood, glanced
cheerfully round the room, satisfied herself that
the letter showed itself sufficiently in the candle
light to attract a roving eye and, bustling forth,
summoned her chair for her departure in a far
better humour than that which had marked her
arrival.
</p>

<p>
"They could not fight till morning," she said
to herself, as she snuggled against the silken
sides.  "Now heaven speed my plan!"  She
breathed a pious prayer as her bearers swung
her onwards.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE IV
</h3>

<p>
For the first time for over a fortnight Sir Jasper
returned to the very fine mansion he had taken
for the Bath season, before the small hours.
</p>

<p>
It was about ten o'clock of the evening that
his impatient hand upon the knocker sent
thunder through the house, startled the
gambling footmen in the hall below and the fat
butler from his comfortable nook at the
housekeeper's fireside and his fragrant glass of
punch.  The nerves of the elder footman were
indeed so shaken that he dropped an ace
from his wide cuff as he swung back the door.
Breathing hot lemon peel, the butler hurried
to receive his master's cloak and cane.  The
ribbons of Mistress Tremlet's cap quivered
over the staircase: the whole household was
agog with curiosity, for her ladyship's woman
had told them to a tear the state of her
ladyship's feelings.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper cursed freely as he entered,
struck the younger footman with his cane
over the calves for gaping, requested a just
Creator to dispose of his butler's soul with
all possible celerity, and himself obligingly
suggested the particular temperature most
suitable to it; then strode he to the
drawing-room with the brief announcement that he
expected the visit of some gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
He looked round scowlingly for his wife.
The room was empty and desolate in spite of
bright chandeliers.  He paused with a
frowning brow, stood a moment irresolute, then
shaped his course for the stairs and mounted
with determined foot.  In my lady's dressing-room,
by one dismal candle, sat her woman,
reading a book of sermons.  She had a long
pink face, had been her ladyship's mother's
own attendant; and much Sir Jasper hated
her.  She rose bristling, dropped him a
curtesy eloquent of a sense of his reprobation;
and he felt that with every line of the homily
she laid by on his appearance she had just
damned him as comfortably as he the butler.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Lud, Lud! (thus she prayed Sir Jasper
in a frightful whisper) would he in mercy walk
softer?  My lady was asleep.  Her ladyship
had been so unwell, so indisposed, that she,
Megrim, had seen the moment when she must
send for the apothecary, and have Sir Jasper
looked for all over Bath.  Sir Jasper did not
seem to realise it, but my lady was of a
delicate complexion: a tender flower!  A
harsh look from Sir Jasper, an unkind word,
much less cruel treatment, and she would slip
through his fingers.  Ay, that she would.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper cast a lowering suspicious look
around.  He glared at the woman, at the
corners of the room, at the closed door.  He
felt his hot jealousy sicken and turn green
and yellow within him.  He stretched out his
hand towards the lock of his wife's door; but
Mistress Megrim came between him and his
purpose with determined movement, her stout
bust creaking in its tight stays.
</p>

<p>
"No," said she, "no, Sir Jasper, unless it
be across my dead corpse!"  Here she trembled
very much and grew red about the eyes
and nose.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said Sir Jasper, and walked
away down the stairs again and into the
empty, lighted drawing-room.  First he halted
by the window, where Lady Standish had
stood and smiled upon Lord Verney.  Then
he went to her writing-desk, and laid his
hand upon the casket where she kept her
correspondence, then withdrawing it with a
murmured curse, turned to the chair where
she sat, and lifted up her bag of silks.  But
this he tossed from him without drawing the
strings.  Another moment and his eye caught
the gleam of the letter so artfully hidden and
exposed by Mistress Bellairs.  He picked it
up and surveyed it; it bore no address, was
vaguely perfumed and fell temptingly open to
his hand.  He spread the sheet and saw the
ruddy curl.  Then his eyes read in spite of
himself.  And as he read the blood rushed to
his brain and turned him giddy, and he sank
on the settee and tore at the ruffles at his neck.
For a moment he suffocated.  With recovered
breath came a fury as voluptuous as a rapture.
He brought the paper to the light and
examined the love-lock.
</p>

<p>
"Red!" said he, "red!"
</p>

<p>
He thought of Lord Verney's olive face, and
looked and glared at the hair again as if he
disbelieved his senses.  Red!  Were there two
of them, a black and a ruddy?  Stay;
oh! women were sly devils!  Lord Verney was a
blind.  This, <i>this</i> carrot Judas was the
consoler!  "There was a patch above the dimple
at the corner of your lip.  I dreamed I kissed
it."  Sir Jasper gave a sort of roar in his soul,
which issued from his lips in a broken groan.
The dimple and the patch!  Ay, he had seen
them!  Only a few short hours ago he had
thought to kiss that dimple with a husband's
lordly pleasure, that dimple, set for another
man!
</p>

<p>
"Blast them! blast them!" cried Sir Jasper
and clenched his hands above his head.  The
world went round with him, and everything
turned the colour of blood.  The next instant
he was cold again, chiding himself for his
passion.  He must be calm, calm, for his
vengeance.  This lock he must trace to its
parent head, no later than to-night, if he had
to scour the town.  He sat down, stretched
the fatal missive before him, and sat staring
at it.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that a visitor, who was
announced as Captain Spicer, presently found
him.  Captain Spicer was an elongated young
gentleman, had a tendency to visual obliquity
and was attired in the extreme of fashion.  He
minced forward, bowing and waving white
hands with delicately crooked fingers.
</p>

<p>
His respects he presented to Sir Jasper.
He had not up to this had the pleasure and
honour of Sir Jasper's acquaintance, but was
charmed of the opportunity&mdash;any opportunity
which should afford him that pleasure and
honour.  Might he, might he?  He extended a
snuff-box, charmingly enamelled, and quivered
it towards his host.  Sir Jasper had risen
stiffly, in his dull eye there was no response.
</p>

<p>
"You do not, then?" said Captain Spicer,
himself extracting a pinch and inhaling it with
superlative elegance and the very last turn of
the wrist.  "And right, my dear sir!  A
vicious habit.  Yet positively," said he, and
smiled engagingly, "without it, I vow, I
could not exist from noon to midnight.  But
then it must be pure Macabaw.  Anything
short of pure Macabaw, fie, fie!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper shook himself and interrupted with
a snarl:
</p>

<p>
"To what, sir, do I owe the honour?"
</p>

<p>
"I come," said Captain Spicer, "of course
you have guessed, from my Lord Verney.
There was a trifle, I believe about&mdash;ha&mdash;the
shape of his nether limbs.  Upon so private a
matter, sir, as his, ahem, nether limbs, a
gentleman cannot brook reflection.  You will
comprehend that my Lord Verney felt hurt, Sir
Jasper, hurt!  I myself, familiar as I am with
his lordship, have never ventured to hint to
him even the name of a hosier, though I
know a genius in that line, sir, a fellow who
has a gift&mdash;a divine inspiration, I may say&mdash;in
dealing with these intimate details!  But Gad,
sir, delicacy, delicacy!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper, meanwhile, had lifted the letter
from the table, and was advancing upon Captain
Spicer, ponderingly looking from the lock of
hair in his hand to that young gentleman's
head, which, however, was powdered to such
a nicety that it was quite impossible to tell
the colour beneath.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," interrupted he at this juncture,
"excuse me, but I should be glad to know if you
wear your hair or a wig?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Spicer leaped a step back, and
looked in amaze at the Baronet's earnest
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Egad!" thought he to himself, "Verney's
in the right of it, the fellow's mad.  Ha! ha!"
said he aloud, "very good, Sir Jasper, very
good.  A little conundrum, eh?  'Rat me, I
love a riddle."  He glanced towards the door.
Sir Jasper still advanced upon him as he
retreated.
</p>

<p>
"I asked you, sir," he demanded with an
ominous rise in his voice, "if you wore your
own hair?"  ("The fellow looks frightened,"
he argued internally&mdash;"'tis monstrous suspicious!")
</p>

<p>
"I," cried the Captain, with his back against
the door fumbling for the handle as he stood.
"Fie, fie, who wears a peruke now-a-days,
unless it be your country cousin?  He, he!
How warm the night is!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper had halted opposite to him and
was rolling a withering eye over his countenance.
</p>

<p>
"His mealy face is so painted," said the
unhappy baronet to himself, "that devil take
him if I can guess the colour of the fellow."  His
hand dropped irresolute by his side.
</p>

<p>
Beads of perspiration sprang on Captain
Spicer's forehead.
</p>

<p>
"If ever I carry a challenge to a madman
again!" thought he.
</p>

<p>
"Your hair is very well powdered," said Sir
Jasper.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is so, it is as you say&mdash;Poudre à la
Maréchale, sir," said the Captain, while under
his persevering finger the door-handle slowly
turned.  An aperture yawned behind him; in
a twinkling his slim figure twisted, doubled,
and was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, hey!" cried Sir Jasper, "stop, man,
stop, our business together has but just begun."
</p>

<p>
But Captain Spicer had reached the street-door.
</p>

<p>
"Look to your master," said he to the
footman, "he is ill, very ill!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper came running after him into the
hall.
</p>

<p>
"Stop him, fools!" cried he to his servants,
and then in the next breath, "Back!" he
ordered.  And to himself he murmured, "'Tis
never he.  That sleek, fluttering idiot never
grew so crisp a curl nor wrote so sturdy a
hand, no, nor kissed a dimple!  <i>Kissed a
dimple</i>!  S'death!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE V
</h3>

<p>
As he stood turning the seething brew of his
dark thoughts, there came a pair of knowing
raps upon the street-door, and in upon him
strode with cheery step and cry the friends
he was expecting.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Jasper, lad," cried Tom Stafford, and
struck him upon his shoulder, "lying in wait
for us?  Gad, you're a blood-thirsty fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"And quite right," said Colonel Villiers,
clinking spurred legs, and flinging off a military
cloak.  "Zounds, man, would you have him
sit down in his dishonour?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper stretched a hand to each; and
holding him by the elbows they entered his
private apartment and closed the door with such
carefulness that the tall footman had no choice
but to take it in turns to listen and peep
through the key-hole.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," said Sir Jasper, "Colonel Villiers,
when I begged you to favour me with this
interview, I was anxious for your services
because, as I told you, of a strong suspicion
of Lady Standish's infidelity to me.  Now,
gentlemen, doubt is no longer possible, I have
the proofs!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Jasper, never be down-hearted,"
cried jovial Tom Stafford.  "Come,
sir, you have been too fond of the little dears
in your day not to know what tender yielding
creatures they are.  'Tis their nature man; and
then, must they not follow the mode?  Do you
want to be the only husband in Bath whose
wife is not in the fashion?  Tut, tut, so long as
you can measure a sword for it and let a little
blood, why, 'tis all in the day's fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Swords?" gurgled Colonel Villiers.  "No,
no, pistols are the thing, boy.  You are never
sure with your sword: 'tis but a dig in the ribs,
a slash in the arm, and your pretty fellow
looks all the prettier for his pallor, and is all
the more likely to get prompt consolation in
the proper quarter.  Ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Consolation!" cried Sir Jasper, as if the
word were a blow.  "Ay, consolation! damnation!"
</p>

<p>
"Whereas with your bullet," said the Colonel,
"in the lungs, or in the brain&mdash;at your choice&mdash;the
job is done as neat as can be.  Are
you a good hand at the barkers, Jasper?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can hit a haystack!" said Sir Jasper.
But he spoke vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"I am for the swords, whenever you can,"
cried comely Stafford, crossing a pair of neat
legs as he spoke and caressing one rounded
calf with a loving hand.  "'Tis a far more
genteel weapon.  Oh, for the feel of the blades,
the pretty talk, as it were, of one with the
other!  'Ha, have I got you now, my friend?'&mdash;'Ha,
would you step between me and my
wife? or my mistress? or my pleasure?'&mdash;as
the case may be.  'Would you?  I will teach
you, sa&mdash;sa!'  Now&mdash;now one in the ribs!
One under that presuming heart!  Let the
red blood flow, see it drop from the steel:
that is something like!  Pistols, what of
them! pooh!  Snap, you blow a pill into the air,
and 'tis like enough you have to swallow it
yourself!  'Tis for apothecaries, say I, and
such as have not been brought up to the
noble and gentlemanly art of self-defence."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, Tom," growled the Colonel; "here
is no matter for jesting.  This friend of ours
has had a mortal affront, has he not?  'Tis
established.  Shall he not mortally avenge
himself upon him who has robbed him of his
honour?  That is the case, is it not?  And,
blast me, is not the pistol the deadlier weapon
and therefore the most suited?  Hey?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper made an inarticulate sound that
might have passed for assent or dissent, or
merely as an expression of excessive discomfort
of feeling.
</p>

<p>
"To business then," cried Colonel Villiers.
"Shall I wait upon Lord Verney and suggest
pistols at seven o'clock to-morrow morning in
Hammer's Fields?  That is where I generally
like to place such affairs: snug enough to be
out of disturbers' way, and far enough to
warm the blood with a brisk walk.  Gad,
'twas but ten days ago that I saw poor Ned
Waring laid as neatly on his back by Lord
Tipstaffe (him they call Tipsy Tip, you know)
as ever it was done; as pretty a fight!  Six
paces, egad, and Ned as determined a dog
as a fellow could want to second.  'Villiers,'
said he, as I handed him his saw-handle, 'if
I do not do for him, may he do for me!  One
of us must kill the other,' said he.  'Twas all
about Mistress Waring, you know, dashed
pretty woman!  Poor Ned, he made a discovery
something like yours, eh?  Faith! ha,
ha!  And devil take it, sir, Tip had him in
the throat at the first shot, and Ned's bullet
took off Tipstaffe's right curl!  Jove, it was
a shave!  Ned never spoke again.  Ah, leave
it to me; see if I do not turn you out as
rare a meeting."
</p>

<p>
"But stay," cried Stafford, as Sir Jasper
writhed in his arm-chair, clenched and
unclenched furious hands and felt the curl of
red hair burn him where he had thrust it
into his bosom.  "Stay," cried Stafford, "we
are going too fast, I think.  Do I not
understand from our friend here that he called
Lord Verney a rat?  Sir Jasper is therefore
himself the insulting party, and must wait for
Lord Verney's action in the matter."
</p>

<p>
"I protest," cried the Colonel, "the first
insult was Lord Verney's in compromising
our friend's wife."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, pooh," exclaimed Stafford, recrossing
his legs to bring the left one into shapely
prominence this time, "that is but the insult
incidental.  But to call a man a rat, that is
the insult direct.  Jasper is therefore the true
challenger; the other has the choice of arms.
It is for Lord Verney to send to our friend!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" exclaimed the Colonel, growing
redder about the gills than Nature and port
wine had already made him.  "Sir, would
you know better than I?"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said Sir Jasper, sitting up
suddenly, "as I have just told you, since I
craved of your kindness that you would help
me in this matter, I have made discoveries
that alter the complexion of the affair very
materially.  I have reason to believe that if
Lord Verney be guilty in this matter it is in
a very minor way.  You know what they call
in France <i>un chandelier</i>.  Indeed it is my
conviction&mdash;such is female artfulness&mdash;that he
has merely been made a puppet of to shield
another person.  It is this person I must find
first, and upon him that my vengeance must
fall before I can attend to any other business.
Lord Verney indeed has already sent to me,
but his friend, Captain Spicer, a poor fool
(somewhat weak in the head, I believe), left
suddenly without our coming to any conclusion.
Indeed, I do not regret it&mdash;I do not seek to
fight with Lord Verney now.  Gentlemen,"
said Sir Jasper, rising and drawing the letter
from his breast&mdash;"gentlemen, I shall neither
eat nor sleep till I have found out the owner
of this curl!"
</p>

<p>
He shook out the letter as he spoke, and
fiercely thrust the tell-tale love-token under the
noses of his amazed friends.  "It is a red-haired
man, you see!  There lives no red-haired man
in Bath but him I must forthwith spit or plug
lest the villain escape me!"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Villiers started to his feet with a
growl like that of a tiger aroused from slumber.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!" he exclaimed.  "An insult."
</p>

<p>
"How!" cried Jasper, turning upon him and
suddenly noticing the sandy hue of his friend's
bushy eyebrows.  "You, good God!  You?
Pooh, pooh, impossible, and yet....  Colonel
Villiers, Sir!" cried Sir Jasper, in awful tones,
"did you write this letter?  Speak!  Yes or
no, man!  Speak, or must I drag the words
from your throat?"
</p>

<p>
Purple and apoplectic passion well-nigh stifled
Colonel Villiers.
</p>

<p>
"Stafford, Stafford," he spluttered, "you are
witness.  These are gross affronts, affronts
which shall be wiped out."
</p>

<p>
"Did you write that letter?  Yes or no!"
screamed Sir Jasper, shaking the offending
document in the Colonel's convulsed countenance.
</p>

<p>
"I?" cried the Colonel, and struck away Sir
Jasper's hand with a furious blow, "I?  I write
such brimstone nonsense?  No, sir!  Now,
damn you body and soul, Sir Jasper, how dare
you ask me such a question?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Sir Jasper, "of course not!  Ah,
I am a fool, Villiers.  Forgive me.  There's
no quarrel between us!  No, of course it could
not be you!  With that nose, that waistcoat,
your sixty years!  Gad, I am going mad!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, man," said Stafford, as soon as he
could speak for laughing, "Villiers has not so
much hair on all his head as you hold in your
hand there.  Off with your wig, Villiers, off
with your wig, and let your bald pate proclaim
its shining innocence."
</p>

<p>
The gallant gentleman thus addressed was
by this time black in the face.  Panting as to
breath, disjointed as to speech, his fury had
nevertheless its well-defined purpose.
</p>

<p>
"I have been insulted, I have been insulted,"
he gasped; "the matter cannot end here.  Sir
Jasper, you have insulted me.  I am a red-haired
man, sir.  I shall send a friend to call upon you."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, then," said Sir Jasper, "since 'tis so
between us I will even assure myself that Tom
has spoken the truth and give you something to
fight for!"  He stretched out his hand as he
spoke, and plucked the wig from Colonel Villiers'
head.
</p>

<p>
Before him indeed spread so complete an
expanse of hairless candour, that further
evidence was not necessary; yet the few limp
hairs that lingered behind the Colonel's ears, if
they had once been ruddy, shone now meekly
silver in the candle-light.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you," said Sir Jasper, "that is
sufficient.  When you send your friend to call
upon me, I shall receive him with pleasure."  He
handed back the Colonel's wig with a bow.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel stood trembling, his knotted
hand instinctively fumbled for his sword.  But
remembering perhaps that this was eminently
a case for pistols, he bethought himself, seized
his wig, clapped it on defiantly, settled it with
minute care, glared, wheeled round and left
the room, muttering as he went remarks of so
sulphurous a nature as to defy recording.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper did not seem to give him another
thought.  He fell into his chair again and
spread out upon his knee the sorely crumpled
letter.
</p>

<p>
"Confusion!" said he.  Who can it be?
"Tom, you scamp, I know your hair is brown.
Thou art not the man, Tom.  Oh, Tom, oh,
Tom, if I do not kill him I shall go mad!"
</p>

<p>
Stafford was weak with laughter, and tears
rolled from his eyes as he gasped:
</p>

<p>
"Let us see, who can the Judas be?  (Gad,
this is the best joke I have known for years.
Oh, Lord, the bald head of him!  Oh, Jasper,
'tis cruel funny!  Stab me, sir, if I have known
a better laugh these ten years!)  Nay, nay, I
will help thee.  Come, there's his Lordship the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, he is red, I know,
for I have seen him in the water.  Gad, he was
like a boiled lobster, hair and all.  Could it be
he, think you?  They have a way, these divines,
and Lady Standish has a delicate conscience.
She would like the approval of the Church upon
her deeds.  Nay, never glare like that, for I
will not fight you!  Have you not got your
rosary of red polls to tell first.  Ha! there is
O'Hara, he is Irish enough and rake enough
and red enough.  Oh, he is red enough!"
</p>

<p>
"O'Hara," cried Sir Jasper, struck.
</p>

<p>
There came a fine rat-tat-tat at the door, a
parley in the hall, and the servant announced
Mr. Denis O'Hara.
</p>

<p>
"Talk of the devil," said Stafford.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper rose from his armchair with the
air of one whose enemy is delivered into his
hands.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE VI
</h3>

<p>
The Honourable Denis O'Hara, son and heir of
Viscount Kilcroney in the peerage of Ireland,
entered with a swift and easy step, and saluted
airily.  He had a merry green eye, and the
red of his crisp hair shone out through the
powder like a winter sunset through a mist.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper," said he, "your servant, sir.
Faith, Tom, me boy, is that you?  The top
of the evening to ye."
</p>

<p>
Uninvited he took a chair and flung his
careless figure upon it.  His joints were loose,
his nose aspired, his rich lace ruffles were torn,
his handsome coat was buttoned awry; Irishman
was stamped upon every line of him, from
his hot red head to his slim alert foot; Irishman
lurked in every rich accent of his ready
tongue.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper made no doubt that now the
Lothario who had poached on his preserves,
had destroyed his peace, had devastated his
home, was before him.  He turned to Stafford
and caught him by the wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," whispered he, "you will stand by
me, for by my immortal soul, I will fight it
out to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, be quiet," whispered the
other, who began to think that the jealous
husband was getting beyond a joke.  "Let us
hear what the fellow has got to say first.  The
devil!  I will not stand by to see you pink
every auburn buck in the town.  'Tis stark
lunacy."
</p>

<p>
"But 'tis you yourself," returned Sir Jasper,
in his fierce undertone&mdash;"you yourself who
told me it was he.  See, but look at this curl
and at that head."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, flummery!" cried Stafford.  "Let him
speak, I say."
</p>

<p>
"When you have done your little conversation,
gentlemen," said Mr. O'Hara good-naturedly,
"perhaps you will let me put in a
word edgeways?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper, under his friend's compelling
hand, sank into a chair; his sinews well-nigh
creaked with the constraint he was putting
upon himself.
</p>

<p>
"I have come," said Denis O'Hara, "from
me friend Captain Spoicer.  I met him a whoile
ago, fluttering down Gay Street, leaping like a
hare with the hounds after him, by St. Patrick!
'You're running away from someone, Spoicer,'
says I.  And says he, 'I'm running away from
that blithering madman Sir Jasper Standish.'  Excuse
me, Sir Jasper, those were his words,
ye see."
</p>

<p>
"And what, sir," interrupted Sir Jasper in
an ominous voice&mdash;"what, sir, may I ask, was
your purpose in walking this way to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh," cried the Irishman, "what is that ye
say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on, O'Hara," cried Stafford
impatiently, and under his breath to Standish,
"Faith, Jasper," said he, "keep your manners,
or I'll wash my hands of the whole matter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that the way with him," said O'Hara,
behind his hand to Stafford, and winked
jovially.  "Well, I was saying, gentlemen, that to
see a man run, unless it be a Frenchman, is a
thing that goes against me.  'Why, what did
he do to you?' said I (meaning you, Sir Jasper).
'Oh,' says me gallant Captain, 'I went to him
with a gentlemanly message from a friend and
the fellow insulted me so grossly with remarks
about my hair, that sure,' says he, 'tis only fit
for Bedlam he is.'  'Insulted you,' says I, 'and
where are you running to?  To look for a
friend, I hope,' says I.  'Insults are stinking
things.'  'Sure,' says he, 'he is mad,' says he.
'Well, what matter of that?' says I.  'Sure,
isn't it all mad we are more or less?  Come,'
says I, 'Spoicer, this will look bad for you
with the ladies, not to speak of the men.  Give
me the message, me boy, and I will take it;
and sure we will let Sir Jasper bring his keepers
with him to the field, and no one can say fairer
than that.'"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now, curse your Irish insolence," he
roared; "this is more than I would stand from
any man!  And, if I mistake not, Mr. O'Hara,
we have other scores to settle besides."
</p>

<p>
"Is it we?" cried O'Hara, jumping up likewise.
"'Tis the first I've heard of them&mdash;but,
be jabers, you will never find me behind hand
in putting me foot to the front!  I will settle
as many scores as you like, Sir Jasper&mdash;so
long as it is me sword and not me purse that
pays them."
</p>

<p>
"Draw then, man, draw!" snarled Sir Jasper,
dancing in his fury.  He bared his silver-hilted
sword and threw the scabbard in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven defend us!" cried Stafford, in vain
endeavouring to come between the two.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, you must not contradict him," cried
O'Hara, unbuckling his belt rapidly, and
drawing likewise with a pretty flourish of shining
blade.  "'Tis the worst way in the world to
deal with a cracked man.  Sure, ye must soothe
him and give in to him.  Don't I know!  Is
not me own first cousin a real raw lunatic in
Kinsale Asylum this blessed day?  Come on,
Sir Jasper, I'm yer man.  Just pull the chairs
out of the way, Tom, me dear boy."
</p>

<p>
"Now sir, now sir!" said Sir Jasper, and
felt restored to himself again as steel clinked
against steel.  And he gripped the ground
with his feet, and knew the joy of action.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what must be, must be," said Stafford
philosophically, and sat across a chair;
"and a good fight is a good fight all the
world over!  Ha! that was a lunge!  O'Hara
wields a pretty blade, but there is danger in
Jasper's eye.  I vow I won't have the Irish
boy killed.  Ha!"  He sprang to his feet
again and brandished the chair, ready to
interpose between the two at the critical moment.
O'Hara was as buoyant as a cork; he
skipped backwards and forwards, from one
side to another, in sheer enjoyment of the
contest.  But Sir Jasper hardly moved from his
first position except for one or two vicious
lunges.  Stafford had deemed to see danger
in his eye; there was more than danger&mdash;there
was murder!  The injured husband was determined
to slay, and bided his time for the fatal
thrust.  The while, O'Hara attacked out of
sheer lightness of heart.  Now his blade grazed
Sir Jasper's thigh; once he gave him a flicking
prick on the wrist so that the blood ran down
his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop," cried Stafford, running in with
his chair, "Sir Jasper's hit!"
</p>

<p>
"No, dash you!" cried Sir Jasper.  And
click, clank, click, it went again, with the pant
of the shortening breath, and the thud of the
leaping feet.  Sir Jasper lunged a third time,
O'Hara waved his sword aimlessly, fell on one
knee, and rolled over.
</p>

<p>
"Halt!" yelled Stafford.  It was too late.
Sir Jasper stood staring at his red blade.
</p>

<p>
"You have killed him!" cried Stafford,
turning furiously on his friend, and was down
on his knees and had caught the wounded
man in his arms the next second.
</p>

<p>
"Devil a bit," said O'Hara, and wriggled
in the other's grasp, too vigorously indeed for
a moribund, found his feet in a jiffy and stood
laughing with a white face and looking down
at his dripping shirt.  "'Tis but the sudden
cold feel of the steel, man!  Sure I'm all
right, and ready to begin again!  'Tis but a
rip in the ribs, for I can breathe as right as
ever."  He puffed noisily as he spoke to prove
his words, slapped his chest, then turned
giddily and fell into a chair.  Stafford tore
open the shirt.  It was as O'Hara had said,
the wound was an ugly surface rip, more
unpleasant than dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"Let us have another bout," said O'Hara.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Stafford.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Sir Jasper advancing and
standing before his adversary.  "No.
Mr. O'Hara, you may have done me the greatest
injury that one can do another, but gad, sir,
you have fought like a gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" whispered O'Hara to Stafford, who
still examined the wound with a knowing
manner, "'tis crazed entoirely he is, the poor
dear fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Not crazed," said Stafford rising, "or if
so, only through jealousy.&mdash;Jasper, let us have
some wine for Mr. O'Hara, and one of your
women with water and bandages.  A little
sticking plaister will set this business to rights.
Thank God, that I have not seen murder to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"One moment, Stafford."  said Jasper, "one
moment, sir.  Let us clear this matter.  Am
I not right, Mr. O'Hara, in believing you to
have written a letter to my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it me?" cried O'Hara in the most guileless
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"He thinks you are her lover," whispered
Stafford in his ear.  "Zooks, I can laugh
again now!  He knows she has got a red-haired
lover, and says he will kill every red-haired
man in Bath!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I have never laid eyes on Lady
Standish," said O'Hara to Sir Jasper, "if that
is all you want.  Sure, I'd have been proud
to be her lover if I'd only had the honour of
her acquaintance!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Hara," said Sir Jasper, "will you
shake hands with me?"
</p>

<p>
"With all the pleasure in loife!" cried the
genial Irishman.  "Faith, 'tis great friends
we will be, but perhaps ye had better not
introjuce me to ye'r lady, for I'm not to
be trusted where the dear creatures are
concerned, and so 'tis best to tell you at the
outset."
</p>

<p>
The opponents now shook hands with some
feeling on either side.  The wound was attended
to and several bottles of wine were thereafter
cracked in great good-fellowship.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing like Canary," vowed
O'Hara, "for the power of healing."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
It was past midnight when, on the arm of
Mr. Stafford, Denis O'Hara set out to return
to his own lodgings.
</p>

<p>
The streets were empty and the night dark,
and they had many grave consultations at the
street corners as to which way to pursue.  If
they reeled a little as they went, if they
marched round King's Circus, and round again
more than once, and showed a disposition to
traverse Gay Street from side to side oftener
than was really required by their itinerary, it
was not, as O'Hara said, because of the
Canary, but all in the way of "divarsion."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper's a jolly good fellow," said Lord
Kilcroney's heir as he propped himself against
his own door-post, and waggled the knocker
with tipsy gravity.  "And so are you," said
he to Stafford.  "I like ye both."  Here he
suddenly showed a disposition to fall upon
Stafford's neck, but as suddenly arrested
himself, stiffened his swaying limbs and struck
his forehead with a sudden flash of sobriety.
"Thunder and 'ouns," said he, "if I did not
clean forget about Spoicer!"
</p>

<p>
He was with difficulty restrained by Stafford
(who, having a stronger head, was somewhat
the soberer), with the help of the servants
who now appeared, from setting forth to
repair his negligence.  By a tactful mixture of
persuasion and force, the wounded gentleman
was at length conducted to bed, sleepily
murmuring:
</p>

<p>
"Won't do at all&mdash;most remiss&mdash;affair of
honour&mdash;never put off!" until sleep overtook
him, which was before his head touched the
pillow.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Sir Jasper sat, with guttering
candles all around him, in the recesses of an
armchair, his legs extended straight, his
bandaged wrist stuffed into his bosom, his head
sunk upon his chest, his spurious flash of
gaiety now all lost in a depth of chaotic
gloom.  Dawn found him thus.  At its first
cold rays he rose sobered, and could not have
said whether the night had passed in waking
anguish or in hideous nightmare.  He looked
round on the cheerless scene, the blood-stained
linen, the empty wine-glasses with their
sickening reek, the smoking candles, the disordered
room; then he shuddered and sought the
haven of his dressing-room, and the relief of
an hour's sleep with a wet towel tied round
his throbbing head.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE VII
</h3>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs was up betimes.  In truth
she had slept ill, which was a strange
experience for her.  What her thirty-seven
lovers had never had the power to wring from
her&mdash;a tear and a sleepless night&mdash;this had
she given to the one man who loved her not.
</p>

<p>
She was tortured with anxiety concerning
the danger which her caprice (or, as she put
it, Lady Standish's inconceivable foolishness)
might have brought upon Lord Verney.  At
daybreak she rang for her maid, and with the
eight o'clock chocolate demanded to be posted
with all the news of the town.  She was of
those who possess the talent of making
themselves served.  The chocolate was to the full
as perfumed and creamy as ever, and Miss
Lydia was bursting with tidings of importance,
as she stood by her lady's couch.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lydia, well?" cried her mistress,
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lud, ma'am, the whole town's ringing
with it!  My Lady Standish has been found
out.  There, I for one never trust those solemn
prudes that ever keep their eyes turned up
or cast down, and their mouths pursed like
cherries.  You would not be so proper if there
was not a reason for it, I always think."
</p>

<p>
"Lydia," said Mistress Bellairs, "do not be
a fool.  Go on; what has Lady Standish been
found out in, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ma'am," said Lydia, "it ain't hard to
guess.  'Tis what a woman's always found out
in, I suppose.  But, lud, the shamelessness of
it!  I hear, ma'am," she came closer to her
mistress and bent to whisper, almost trembling
with the joy of being tale-bearer to such
purpose, "I hear, ma'am, Sir Jasper found Colonel
Villiers there yesterday afternoon.  Oh, ma'am,
such goings on!"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said Mistress Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they're going to fight, anyhow," cried
the girl, "and Sir Jasper tore off the Colonel's
wig and beat him about the face with it,
ma'am, and the Colonel's been like a madman
ever since, and he vows he will shoot him this
morning."
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs gave a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"Let them shoot each other," said she,
sinking back on her pillows and stirring her
chocolate calmly.  "I do not find the world
any better for either of them."
</p>

<p>
"But that is not all, ma'am, for poor Sir
Jasper no sooner had he thrashed the Colonel,
than he finds Mr. Denis O'Hara behind the
curtains."
</p>

<p>
"Denis O'Hara!" exclaimed Mistress Bellairs,
sitting up in amaze.  "You're raving!"
</p>

<p>
"No, ma'am, for I have it from Mr. O'Hara's
own man; and did not he and Sir
Jasper fight it out then and there, and was not
Mr. O'Hara carried home wounded by the
Watch!"
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" exclaimed the lady.
</p>

<p>
"And that is not all, ma'am," said the maid.
</p>

<p>
"You frighten me, child."
</p>

<p>
"There is Captain Spicer too, whom you
can't a-bear, and Lord Verney."
</p>

<p>
"Lord Verney!" cried Mistress Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ma'am; he and Sir Jasper are going to
fight this morning.  Sir Jasper's going to fight
them all, but Lord Verney is to be the first, for
Sir Jasper found him kissing Lady Standish
yesterday at noon; the others were later on.
So it's my Lord comes first you see, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"La, girl," cried Mistress Bellairs with a
scream, and upset her chocolate, "going to
fight this morning?  'Tis not true!"  Her
pretty face turned as white as chalk under its
lace frills.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am," pursued the maid, gabbling
as hard as she could.  "Yes, ma'am, first
there's Lord Verney.  Sir Jasper, they say,
behaved so oddly to Captain Spicer who
brought the first challenge, that Lord Verney
sent another by a chairman this morning.
And then Colonel Villiers.  Of course, as
Mr. Mahoney says (that's Mr. O'Hara's man,
ma'am), Sir Jasper is safe to kill Lord Verney,
and Colonel Villiers is safe to kill Sir Jasper.
But if the Colonel do not kill Sir Jasper, then
Sir Jasper will fight Captain Spicer!  La! ma'am,
the chocolate's all over the bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, get out of that, you silly wench,"
cried Mistress Bellairs, "let me rise!  There
is not a moment to lose.  And where is Sir
Jasper supposed to fight my Lord Verney?
(Give me my silk stockings, useless thing that
you are!)  I don't believe a word of your
story.  How dare you come and tell me such
a pack of nonsense?  But where are they
supposed to fight?  Of course you must have
heard the hour?"  She was pulling silk
stockings over her little arched foot, and up her
little plump leg as fast as her trembling hands
would obey her.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know where, ma'am," said the
maid demurely, "but the Colonel is to meet
Sir Jasper in Hammer's Fields at noon, so I
suppose my Lord Verney and he will be fighting
about this time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hold your tongue," cried her mistress;
"you're enough to drive one mad with your
quacking!"
</p>

<p>
Not a dab of rouge did the widow find
time to spread upon pale cheeks, not a dust
of powder upon a black curl.  The pretty
morning hood was drawn round a very different
face from that which it usually shaded; but
who shall say that Kitty, the woman, running
breathless through the empty streets with the
early breeze playing with her loose hair, was
not as fair in her complete self-abandonment,
as the fashionable lady, powdered, painted,
patched and laced, known under the name
of Mrs. Bellairs?  Her small feet hammered
impatiently along, her skirts fluttered as she
went.  She would not wait for a coach; a
chair would have sent her crazy.
</p>

<p>
At the turning of the Crescent, another
fluttering woman's figure, also hooded, also
cloaked, also advancing with the haste that
despises appearances, passed her with a patter
and a flash.  They crossed, then moved by
the same impulse halted with dawning recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Bellairs!" cried Lady Standish's
flute-like voice.
</p>

<p>
"Julia Standish!" screamed Mistress Bellairs.
They turned and caught at each other
with clinging hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, heavens," said Mistress Bellairs, "is
what I hear true?  Is that devil Sir Jasper
going to fight Lord Verney this morning?
Why, Verney's but a child; 'tis rank murder.
You wicked woman, see what you have done!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mistress Bellairs," cried Julia, and
pressed her side, "my heart is broken."
</p>

<p>
"But what has happened, woman, what has
happened?" cried Kitty, and shook the
plaintive Julia with a fierce hand.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper will not see me," sobbed Julia,
"but I have found out that he is to meet
my Lord Verney in an hour in Bathwick
Meadows.  There have been messages going
backwards and forwards since early dawn.  Oh,
Heaven have pity on us!"
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" cried Kitty, and
shook her once more.
</p>

<p>
"I was going to Lord Verney to plead for
my husband's life," said Lady Standish, and
the tears streamed down her face like the
storm-rain upon lily flowers.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord keep you," cried Mistress
Bellairs with feelings too deep for anger; "I
believe you are no better than an idiot!"
</p>

<p>
The most heroic resolves are often the work
of a second!  "Now go back home again,
you silly thing," said Kitty.  "'Tis I&mdash;yes,
Lady Standish, you do not deserve it of me&mdash;but
I will sacrifice myself!  I will prevent
this duel, I will go to my Lord Verney!"
</p>

<p>
"You," said Julia, and wondered, and but
half understood the meaning of the words.
</p>

<p>
"Go home, go home," said Mistress Kitty,
"and I tell you that if I do not make Lord
Verney fail at the meeting, my name is not
Kitty Bellairs!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish hesitated, and meekly bowed
her head, turned and began to retrace her steps,
her slim figure bending and swaying as if the
fresh morning wind were too stern for her.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs looked at her watch.
</p>

<p>
"Did she say an hour?" murmured she
to herself.  "Then, ten minutes before the
looking-glass, and ten minutes to get to my
Lord's lodgings, and I will find him about
to start.  'Tis his first affair of honour, poor
boy, and he is sure to be as early at it as
a country cousin to a dinner-party."
</p>

<p>
The sun broke out from a cloudy sky, and
Mrs. Bellairs shook herself and felt her spirits
rise.  A dimple peeped in either cheek.
</p>

<p>
"After all," said she as she tripped along,
and the dimples deepened as the smile
broadened, "who knows?  'Tis an ill wind that
blows nobody good."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
My Lady Standish returned home.  The
servants stared at her curiously as she crossed
the hall.  Mistress Tremlet, the housekeeper,
passed her with pursed lips.  Her own maid,
she knew, was dissolved in tears and plunged
in Doctor Persel's discourses against heresy.
White as new fallen snow was her conscience,
nevertheless she felt herself smirched in the
eyes of all these people.  Yet she cared not.
</p>

<p>
Outside Sir Jasper's dressing-room she
listened.  She could hear him stamp about
as he made his toilet, and curse his man.
She put out her hand to knock, but the
memory of his stern repulse to her last
appeal robbed her of all courage.
</p>

<p>
"I will not go in upon him," thought she,
"but when he comes out I will speak."
</p>

<p>
"These swords," said Sir Jasper within, "I
will take in the carriage.  I expect Mr. Stafford
and a friend to call for me in half-an-hour.
Do you understand, sirrah!  And hark ye,
where are the pistols?"
</p>

<p>
"Pistols!" echoed Lady Standish, and her
heart beat to suffocation.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Sir Jasper," said the valet then.
</p>

<p>
"Now, mark what I say," said Jasper
impressively.  "Lord Markham will call at eleven.
Let the curricle be in waiting; tell my Lord
that I will meet him five minutes before the
half-hour at Hammer's Fields.  Forget at your
peril!  You are to take these pistols there
yourself.  Stay, tell my Lord Markham that
if I am not at the <i>rendezvous</i>, 'twill only be
because I have not life enough left to take me
there, and he must make it straight with
Colonel Villiers.  Have you understood, rascal?
Nay&mdash;damn you!&mdash;I will give you a letter for
my Lord Markham."
</p>

<p>
"Oh God! oh God!" cried poor Lady
Standish, and felt her knees tremble, "what
is this now?  Another meeting!  The
Colonel! ... In God's name how comes he upon
Colonel Villiers?  Why, this is wholesale
slaughter!  This is insanity!  This must be
prevented!"  She caught her head in her
hands.  "Sir Jasper's mad," she said.  "What
shall I do?  What shall I do?  They will kill
him, and I shall have done it.  Why now, if
Kitty prevents the first duel, cannot I prevent
the second?  Oh, I am a false wife if I cannot
save my husband.  Heaven direct me!" she
prayed, and to her prayer came inspiration.
</p>

<p>
There was the Bishop, the Bishop of Bath
and Wells!  That reverend prelate had shown
her much kindness and attention; he would
know how to interfere in such a crisis.  He
was a man of authority.  Between them could
they not enforce the peace at Hammer's
Fields, and could not Sir Jasper be saved in
spite of himself, were it by delivering him
into the hands of the law?
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish flew into her room and called
the sniffing Megrim.
</p>

<p>
"Paper and ink," cried she, "and get you
ready to run on a message.  'Tis a matter
of life and death."
</p>

<p>
"My Lady," said Megrim primly, "I will
serve your Ladyship in all things that are
right; but I hope I know my dooty to my
Creator; and stoop to connive at irregularities,
my Lady, I won't and never will."  She
had been ready to condemn her master
overnight, but the talk in the servants' hall had,
as she expressed it, "opened her eyes."  And
what woman is not ready to judge her sister
woman&mdash;above all, what maid to condemn her
mistress?
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish stared.
</p>

<p>
"What means this?" said she.  "You shall
do as I bid you, Mistress Megrim.  How
dare you!" cried Lady Standish with a sudden
flash of comprehension.  "Why, woman, my
letter is to the Bishop!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," quoth Mistress Megrim, still with
reserve, yet condescending to approval, "that
is another matter!  Shall I," she sniffed, "be
stricter than becomes a Christian?  Shall I
refuse aid to the bruised sinner or to the
smoking lamp whose conscience is awakened?
May his Lordship be a tower of strength to
your Ladyship along the rocky paths of
penitence&mdash;Amen!"
</p>

<h3>
SCENE VIII
</h3>

<p>
In ten minutes a fair lady may do much to
enhance her fairness.  As Mistress Bellairs
took a last look at her mirror, while Lydia
bustled out to call a hired chair, she bestowed
upon her reflection a smile of approval which
indeed so charming an image could not fail
to call forth.  Then she huddled herself in a
mysterious and all enveloping cloak, caught
up a little velvet mask from the table, and
sped upon her errand.  She sallied forth as
the gallant soldier might to battle, with a
beating heart yet a high one.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney and Captain Spicer had just
finished breakfast at the former's lodgings in
Pierrepoint Street, near North Parade.  Captain
Spicer, babbling ineptly of his own experience
as a duellist, of his scorn of Sir Jasper's
lunacy, yet of his full determination to slay
the vile madman, had done ample justice to
his young principal's table.  But Lord Verney,
his cheek now darkly flushed, now spread with
an unwholesome pallor, found it hard to swallow
even a mouthful of bread, and restlessly passed
from the contemplation of the clock and the
setting of his watch to the handling of his
pistols, or the hasty addition of yet another
postscript to the ill-spelt, blotted farewell
epistle he had spent half the night in inditing
to the Dowager his mother: "In case, you
know..." he had said to his friend, with
a quiver in his voice.
</p>

<p>
Captain Spicer had earnestly promised to
carry out his patron's last wishes in the most
scrupulous manner.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lord," he had said, grasping him
by the hand, "rely upon me.  Gad, Sir Jasper
is a devil of a shot I hear, and of course, he,
he! we all know the saying&mdash;the strength of
a madman.  But no sooner has he laid you,
Harry, than I vow, upon my honour, I shall
hold him at my sword's point.  I will revenge
thee, Harry, never fear of that.  'Twill be a
mighty genteel story, and the world will ring
with it.  Egad, he will not be the first I
have spitted as easy as your cook would
spit a turkey.  Have I not learnt of the
great Angelo Malevolti himself?  He,
he&mdash;'A woman's hand,' he would say, 'and the
devil's head!'"
</p>

<p>
Here Captain Spicer shook out his bony
fingers from the encumbering ruffles and
contemplated them with much satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang you, Spicer, be quiet, can't you!"
cried Lord Verney petulantly.
</p>

<p>
The Captain leant back on his chair and
began to pick his teeth with a silver toothpick.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, these novices!" said he, as if to
himself.  "Keep your nerves steady, my Lord,
or, stab me, I may as well order the mourning-coach
before we start.  He, he!  'Tis well,
indeed, you have a friend to stand by you!"
</p>

<p>
A discreet tap was heard at the door, and
Lord Verney's impassive new servant
(especially engaged on his behalf by the Captain,
who indeed, some ill-natured wag had it,
shared his wages and perquisites) stood in
the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"There is a lady downstairs, my Lord," he
said in his mechanical voice.  "She particularly
requests to see your Lordship and will
take no denial, although I informed her that
your Lordship was like to be engaged until
late in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney merely stared in amazement;
but Captain Spicer sprang up from his chair,
his pale eyes starting with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"A lady, gad!  Verney, you dog, what is
this?  A lady, Ned?  Stay, is she tall and
fair and slight?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, she is under-sized, and seems
plump, though she is wrapt in so great a
cloak I could hardly tell."
</p>

<p>
"Pretty, man?"
</p>

<p>
"Cannot say, sir, she wears a mask."
</p>

<p>
"A mask?  He, Verney, Verney, this is
vastly interesting!  And she won't go away,
eh, Ned?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, she must see his Lordship, she
said, if only for five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Plump, under-sized, masked," ejaculated
Captain Spicer in burning perplexity.  "Gad,
we have ten minutes yet, we will have her
up, eh, Verney?  Show her up, Ned."
</p>

<p>
The servant withdrew, unheeding Lord
Verney's stammered protest.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Captain Spicer," said he, "I would
have liked to have kept these last ten minutes
for something serious.  I would have liked,"
said the lad with a catch in his voice and
a hot colour on his cheek, "to have read a
page of my Bible before starting, were it only
for my mother's sake, afterwards."
</p>

<p>
The led Captain threw up hand and eye
in unfeigned horror.
</p>

<p>
"A page of your Bible!  Zounds!  If it
gets out, we are the laughing-stock of Bath.
A page of your Bible!  'Tis well no one
heard you but I."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Lord Verney, for in the
doorway stood their visitor.  'Twas indeed a
little figure, wrapt in a great cloak, and
except for the white hand that held the folds,
and the glimpse of round chin and cherry lip
that was trembling beneath the curve of the
mask, there was naught else to betray her
identity, to tell whether she were young or
old, well-favoured or disinherited.  But it was
a charming little hand, and an engaging little
chin.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney merely stood and stared like
the boy he was.  But Captain Spicer leaped
forward with a spring like a grasshopper, and
crossing his lean shanks, he presented a chair
with the killing grace of which he alone was
master.  The lady entered the room, put her
hand on the back of the chair, and turned
upon Captain Spicer.
</p>

<p>
"I would see Lord Verney alone, sir," she
said.  It was a very sweet voice, but it was
imperious.  The masked lady had all the
air of one who was accustomed to instant
obedience.
</p>

<p>
In vain Captain Spicer leered and languished;
the black eyes gleamed from behind
the disguise very coldly and steadily back at
him.  Forced to withdraw, he endeavoured
to do so with wit and elegance, but he was
conscious somehow of cutting rather a poor
figure; and under the unknown one's hand
the door closed upon him with so much
energy as to frustrate utterly his last bow.
</p>

<p>
Kitty Bellairs deliberately turned the key
in the lock, and put it in her pocket.  Lord
Verney started forward, but was arrested by
the sound of his own name, pronounced in
the most dulcet and plaintive tone he thought
he had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Verney," said Kitty, flinging back
her cloak and hood and allowing her pretty
brown curls, and a hint of the most perfect
shape in Bath, to become visible to the young
peer's bewildered gaze.  "Lord Verney," said
she, and clasped her hands, "a very, very
unhappy woman has come to throw herself
upon your compassion."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Lord Verney, "what can
I do for you?"  His boyish soul was thrilled
by these gentle accents of grief; he thought
he saw a tear running down the white chin;
the rounded bosom heaved beneath its
bewitching disorder of lace.  He glanced at the
clock and back at the suppliant in a cruel
perplexity.  "Madam," said he, "time presses;
I have but a few minutes to give you.  Tell
me, madam, how can I serve you?  To do
so will be a comfort to me in what is perhaps
the last hour of my life."
</p>

<p>
The lady gave a cry as soft as a dove's,
and as plaintive.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said she, "it is true, then, what I
heard?" and the white hands were wrung
together as in extremest anguish.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," cried he, with outspread arms,
and, though without daring to touch her,
drawing closer, so close as to hear the quick
catch of her breath and to inhale the subtle
fragrance of violets that emanated from her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said she, "it is true!"  She staggered
and caught at the fastenings of her cloak and
threw it open.
</p>

<p>
"You are faint," he cried, strangely moved;
"let me call."
</p>

<p>
But she caught him by the hand.  Her
fingers were curiously warm for one seized
with faintness, but the touch of them was
pleasant to the young man as never woman's
touch had been before.  Out flew the fellow
hand to keep his prisoner, and they clung
round his great boy's wrist.
</p>

<p>
He never knew how, but suddenly he was
on his knees before her.
</p>

<p>
"You are going to fight," said she, "to
fight with Sir Jasper.  Oh, my God, you do
not know, but it is because of me, and if you
fight it will break my heart."  She leant
forward to look eagerly at him as he knelt.  Her
breath fanned his cheek.  Through her mask
he saw beautiful black eyes, deep, deep.  How
white the skin was upon her neck and chin&mdash;how
fine its grain!  What little wanton curls
upon her head!  What a fragrance of flowers
in the air!  How he longed to pluck that
mask away&mdash;and yet how the very mystery
lured him, held him!
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" said he, in a low quick
whisper.  "Let me see your face."
</p>

<p>
She forbade his indiscreet hand with a little
shriek.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no, you must never see, never
know; that would be terrible."
</p>

<p>
Then he placed both his hands, all unconsciously,
upon hers, and then she caught them
both and held them, and he felt that her weak
grasp was to him as strong as iron.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you fight?" said she.  "Tell me."
</p>

<p>
He blushed.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis for nothing, the merest misunderstanding.
Sir Jasper is mad, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper is jealous," breathed she, and
nearer came the gaze of the eyes.  "Is it
true that you love Lady Standish?"
</p>

<p>
"I?" cried he vehemently, and rapped out
a great oath&mdash;so eager was he to deny.  "I?
No!  God is my witness.  No!"
</p>

<p>
"Then do not fight," said she.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to look at the clock; he wanted
to spring up and rush to the door; he was
conscious that Spicer was knocking gently,
and that it was time to go where the conventions
of honour called him.  The soft clasp
held him, and the mysterious eyes.  He was
a very boy, and had never loved before,
and&mdash;she was masked!
</p>

<p>
"Let me advise you," said she.  "Believe
me, your welfare is dearer to me than you can
imagine&mdash;dearer to me than I ought to tell
you.  Believe me, if you give up this duel
you will live to be glad of it.  Sir Jasper will
thank you no later than this very day, as never
man thanked man before.  And you will make
me so happy!  Oh, believe me, your honour
is safe with me."
</p>

<p>
"Only let me see your face," said he, while
Spicer knocked louder.  "I will see her, and
kiss her," he thought to himself, "and that
will be something to carry to my death."
</p>

<p>
"How dare you ask it?" she said.  "Must
I grant your request when you refuse me
mine?"
</p>

<p>
"And if I grant you yours," said he, as his
heart beat very fast, "what will you give me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, give," said she, "give!  Who cares
for gifts?  A man must take."  Her red lip
beneath the mask here became arched so
bewitchingly over a row of the whitest teeth in
all the world, that Harry Verney, whose head
had been rapidly going, lost it and his heart
together.
</p>

<p>
"That is a challenge," said he, as he drew
a hand away and lifted it to the mask.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, traitor!" she cried, and made a dainty
start of resistance.  His fingers trembled on
the soft scented locks.
</p>

<p>
"You shall not," said she, and bent her
head to avoid his touch, so that as he knelt
their faces were closer together than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried he, and kissed her on the chin
beneath the mask.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
SCENE IX
</h3>

<p>
"My Lord," clamoured Captain Spicer at the
door, "the coach is waiting and we have but
half an hour to reach Bathwick Meadows.
Egad, Lord Verney, would you be last at the
meeting?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney sprang to his feet.  The words,
the impatient raps penetrated to his dizzy brain
with sudden conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" cried he, and glanced at the
clock, and made a leap for the door.
</p>

<p>
"And will you go," said the stranger, "without
having seen my face?"
</p>

<p>
He ran back to her and then back to the door
again, distracted, as you may see a puppy dog
between two calls.  Finally he came back to the
lady with a new and manly dignity upon him.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," he said.  "Would you show
yourself as kind as you seem, madam, remove
your mask that I may see you before I go."
</p>

<p>
Outside Captain Spicer was dancing a sort of
hornpipe of impotent impatience, and filling the
air with shrill strange oaths.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs put the lean swarthy boy
very composedly on one side by the merest
touch of her hand, then she went over to the
door, unlocked it and admitted Captain Spicer,
green and sweating.
</p>

<p>
"I am coming, Spicer," cried Lord Verney
desperately, and made a plunge for his hat and
cloak, murmuring as he passed the lady: "Oh
cruel!"
</p>

<p>
Kitty Bellairs nibbled her little finger and
looked at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"It will not take you, you know," said she,
"more than five minutes to drive down to the
Bathwick ferry, therefore if you start in three
you will still have twenty-six to spare.  My
Lord Verney, will you give me those three
minutes?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney flung aside hat and cloak again,
his face glowing with a dark flush.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried he, like a school-boy, "for God's
sake, Spicer, wait outside."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Mistress Kitty, smiling to herself
under her mask, "nay, I have need of Captain
Spicer."
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney's face fell,
</p>

<p>
"Come hither," said she, and took him crestfallen
by the hand and brought him to the table,
where lay the writing materials he had been
using but a little while ago.  "Here," said she,
"is a sheet of paper.  Sit down, my Lord, and
write, write," she said, and tapped his shoulder;
"write, sir&mdash;thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
'Lord Verney begs to inform Sir Joseph Standish that he
understands the grounds of the quarrel between them to lie
in a gross misconception of Lord Verney's feelings for Lady
Standish.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Write, write!"  She leaned over him, dictating.
</p>

<p>
Half spell-bound, yet protesting incoherently,
he began to cover the page with his awkward
scrawl.
</p>

<p>
"Quick," said she.  "(Child, how do you
spell quarrel?) Never mind, on with you:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
'Lord Verney begs to assure Sir Jasper that, so far from
presuming to entertain any unlawful sentiments for Lady
Standish, he has never addressed more than three words to
her or as many glances at her in his-life; that his whole
heart is given to another lady, the only woman he has ever
loved and ever will love.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The pen nearly dropped from Lord Verney's
fingers.  He started and turned round on his
chair to graze in amaze into the countenance of
his mysterious visitor, and again was at once
attracted and foiled by her mask.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you would not contradict a lady?"
she whispered in his ear; "haste, we have but
one minute more.  Here, give me the pen, I
will finish."  She snapped the quill from his
hand, her curls touched his cheek as she bent
forward over him to the page.  Swiftly her
little hand flew:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"If upon this explanation Sir Jasper does not see his way
to retract all the offensive observations he made to Lord
Verney, Lord Verney will be ready to meet him as arranged
without an instant's delay.  The truth of all these statements
is guaranteed by the woman Lord Verney loves."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She seized the sheet and folded it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Captain Spicer," said she, "take your
coach and hie you to Sir Jasper's house, and
if you bring back an answer before the clock
strikes, I will let you take off my mask, and that
will save you from dying of curiosity and, also,
give you something to tattle about for the next
month.  Oh, you will find Sir Jasper," she said;
"he is a seasoned hand, and does not, like your
virgin duellist, make it a point of honour to
bring his high valour to the rendezvous twenty
minutes before the time."
</p>

<p>
Within his meagre body Captain Spicer
carried the soul of a flunkey.  He would have
given worlds to rebel, but could not.
</p>

<p>
"So long as it is not a put-off," said he.
"Not even for a fair one's smile could I barter
a friend's honour."
</p>

<p>
Kitty held the letter aloft tantalizingly and
looked at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"If you won't be the bearer," said she, "I
will send it by the chairman, and then you will
never know what is in it.  Moreover," said she,
and smiled archly, "if Sir Jasper apologises to
Lord Verney, which, upon receipt of this letter,
I make no doubt he will, you can take his place,
you know, and will not be done out of a gallant
meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, ha, of course!" cried Spicer with
a yellow smile.
</p>

<p>
Laughing, Mistress Kitty closed the door
behind his retreating figure.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what have you done, what have you
made me do?" cried Harry Verney in a sudden
agony.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said Mistress Kitty.  "Did I not
tell you your honour was safe with me?  Do
you not believe me?" said she meltingly.
"Ah, Verney!"  She put her hand to her
head, and at her touch the mask fell.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her face, blushing and quivering
upon him, and once more fell on his knee
at her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell me your name!" cried he, pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Lord Verney," she said, "how ungallant!"  She
smiled and looked bewitchingly
beautiful; looked serious and reproachful, and
he fell beyond his depths in rapture.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you know me, you know me well,"
said she, "am I not Mistress Bellairs, Kitty
Bellairs&mdash;am I not, Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," cried he, "I never knew you
till this hour, madam, Mistress Bellairs Kitty!
I see you," he cried, "for the first time!  Oh,
God, be kind to me, for I love her!"
</p>

<p>
"And yet," she whispered archly, "they say
that love is blind."
</p>

<p>
Upon this he kissed her as he had kissed
her beneath the mask; and if anything could
have been sweeter than the first kiss it was
the second.
</p>

<p>
Ah, love, how easy an art to learn, how hard
to unlearn!
</p>

<p>
While Harry Verney thus forgot the whole
world, his first duel, and the code of honour.
Sir Jasper sat inditing an answer to his
communication:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"Sir Jasper Standish has received my Lord Verney's
explanation in the spirit in which it is offered.  He is
quite ready to acknowledge that he has acted entirely
under a misapprehension, and begs Lord Verney to receive
his unreserved apologies and the expression of his admiration
for Lord Verney's gallant and gentlemanly behaviour,
together with his congratulations to him and the unknown
lady upon their enviable situation."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Captain Spicer did not offer to supply his
principal's place in the field.  Indeed, he
displayed to Sir Jasper, who received him
with the most gloomy courtesy, the extreme
suppleness of his spine, and pressed his
unrivalled snuff upon him with a fluttering and
ingratiating air.
</p>

<p>
When he returned to Pierrepoint Street he
found the mysterious stranger already in her
sedan, Lord Verney leaning through the window
thereof, engaged in an earnest whispering
conversation.  Captain Spicer jocularly pulled him
back by the coat-tails and inserted his own
foolish face instead.  The lady was masked
and cloaked as he had left her.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I have done your errand," said
he.  "It was," said he, "a matter of difficult
negotiation, requiring&mdash;ahem&mdash;requiring such
tact as I think I may call my own.  Sir
Jasper was vastly incensed, one might as well
have tried to reason with a bull.  'But gad,
sir,' said I, 'would I, I, Captain Spicer, come
with this message if it were not in accordance
with the strictest rule of honourable etiquette?'  That
floored him, madam&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Mistress Kitty snatched the letter
flickering in his gesticulating hand with scant
ceremony, turned her shoulder upon him, read
it and handed it out to Lord Verney, who
had lost no time in coming round to the
other window.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said she, "bid the man take me
to the Pump Room."  She leaned her head
out and Lord Verney put his close to hers,
and there followed another conclave.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, madam, I demand the fulfilment
of your promise!" from the other side came
Captain Spicer's clamouring thin voice.&mdash;"Verney,
my good fellow, I must request you
to retire, there is a compact between this lady
and me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A compact?" said the mask turning her head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madam, the vision of that entrancing
countenance!"
</p>

<p>
He strove to unfasten the chair door, when:
</p>

<p>
"What?" cried she, "and rob you of all
the charm of uncertainty and all the joy of
guessing and all the spice of being able to
take away the character of every lady in
Bath.  Oh," she said, "I hope I have been better
taught my duty to my neighbour!"  Out went
her head again to Lord Verney; there was
another whisper, a silver laugh.  "On men!"
she cried.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney skipped round and in his turn
dragged the discomfited Captain out of the
window and restrained him by main force
from running after the retreating chairman and
their fair burden.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE X
</h3>

<p>
Lord Markham was a person of indefinite
appearance, indefinite age and indefinite
manners.  He wore an ill-fitting wig, but he
had a high reputation as a man of honour.
He sat beside Sir Jasper on the front seat,
while on the back sat Tom Stafford; and
the curricle sped cheerily along through the
up-and-down Bath streets out into the country
budding with green, down, down the hill, to
Hammer's Fields by the winding Avon.  Sir
Jasper's face bespoke great dissatisfaction with
life at large, and with his own existence in
particular.  Tom Stafford was beginning to
feel slightly bored.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis an early spring," said Lord Markham,
in the well-meant endeavour to beguile away
the heavy minutes and distract his principal's
mind.  "'Tis very mild weather for the time
of year; and the lambs are forward."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" said Sir Jasper.
</p>

<p>
"Speak not to him of lambs," whispered
Stafford; "do not you see he is all for blood
and thunder?"
</p>

<p>
Then he added maliciously; "There is but
one animal in the whole fauna that Sir Jasper
takes an interest in at present; and that's not
easy, it seems, to find in these purlieus, though
we know it does haunt them: 'tis the red
dear!"  He chuckled, vastly delighted with
the conceit.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope we shall not have rain," said
Lord Markham; "these clouds are menacing."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, they will hold up for half-an-hour.
Enough to serve our purpose," growled Sir
Jasper, and tipped the horses with the lash
so that they spurned the slope.
</p>

<p>
"But we shall get wet returning," pleaded
the well-meaning Earl, "I said so all along;
'twould have been better to have gone in a
coach."
</p>

<p>
"I vow," cried Sir Jasper with a sudden
burst of spleen, "I vow that I have it in my
heart to wish that Villiers' ball may speed so
well that I may feel neither rain nor shine,
coming home again.  Home again," said he
with a withering smile; "blast it, a pretty
home mine is!"
</p>

<p>
"And a pretty cheerful fellow you are to
bring out to a merry meeting," quoth Stafford
from the back, "and a nice pair of fools you
and the Colonel be, plague on you both!
And when you are shot, 'twill be a fine
satisfaction to think that your wife can console
herself with the owner of the red curl, eh?
What are you going to fight old Villiers about,
I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"You do know," growled Sir Jasper, then
he exploded.  "You goad me, sir; do <i>I</i> want
to fight Villiers?  Is not this business the
merest fooling; sheer waste of time when the
real fellow&mdash;villain!&mdash;has eluded me?"  His
hold on the reins tightened, he laid on the
whip, and the curricle swayed as the horses
leaped and plunged.
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Lord Markham, "I wish I
had come in a coach."
</p>

<p>
And: "Hold on," cried Stafford, "hold on,
Jasper; we don't all want to leave our bones
in this business."
</p>

<p>
There came a pause in the conversation.
They bowled alone a more level road with
the wind humming in their ears, and the
rhythmic trot of the greys beating a tune.
Then Stafford remarked vaguely:
</p>

<p>
"I have a notion there will be no duel
to-day at Hammer's Fields, Jasper, that you will
be able to return with undiminished vigour to
the hunt of the unknown culprit."
</p>

<p>
"How now," cried Sir Jasper fiercely, "have
you heard from Villiers?  Are they all rats
now-a-days?  Verney first, then that Spicer, then the
Colonel!  No, no, the fellow was mad with me,
sir; and&mdash;gad!&mdash;the offence was mine!"
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," said Stafford unmoved, "I
happen to know that Colonel Villiers' man was
sent in all haste for his physician, Sir George
Waters, at such an unconscionable hour this
morning that Sir George despatched the
apothecary in his stead, and the apothecary
found our fire-eating Colonel roaring in a fit of
the most violent gout 'tis possible to imagine.
So violent, indeed, that poor Mr. Wigginbotham
was soundly beat by the Colonel for
not being Sir George.  Villiers' foot is as large
as a pumpkin, old Foulks tells me; I had it
all from Foulks over a glass of water in the
Pump Room this morning, and zooks, sir, his
false teeth rattled in his head as he tried to
describe to me the awful language Colonel
Villiers was using.  He's to be Villiers' second,
you know, but he swore 'twas impossible, rank
impossible, for any man to put such a foot to
the ground."
</p>

<p>
They were rounding the corner of Hammer's
Fields as he spoke, and Stafford's eyes
roaming over the green expanse of grass rested
upon the little group drawn up towards the
entrance gate.
</p>

<p>
"Unless," he went on, "the Colonel comes
upon crutches.  No, zounds! ha, ha!  Jasper
I will always love you, man, for the capital
jokes you have provided of late.  Strike me
ugly if the old fellow has not come&mdash;<i>in a bath-chair</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Lord Markham, "this is very
irregular.  I have never before been privy to a
duel where one of the combatants fought in a
chair.  And I am not sure that I can undertake
the responsibility of concluding arrangements
in such circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Blasted nonsense!" said Sir Jasper with
all his former urbanity of demeanour.  He
flung the reins to his man as he spoke, and
clambered down from the curricle.  Stafford
had gone before him to the gate and was now
stamping from one foot to another in exquisite
enjoyment of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"(Ha, ha, ha!) Hello!  Morning, Colonel,
sorry to see you this way!  (Ha, ha!)  Have
you brought another bath-chair for our man?
Oh come, yes.  'Twon't be fair if he do not
sit in a bath-chair too!  Say, Foulks, you
wheel one chair, I'll wheel the other, and we
will run them one at the other and let them
fire as soon as they please.  Gad, what a joke!"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Villiers turned upon his volatile friend
a countenance the colour of which presented
some resemblance to a well-defined bruise on
the third day; it was yellow and green with
pain where it was not purple with fury.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stafford, sir, these jokes, sir, are vastly
out of place.  (Curse this foot!)  Mr. Foulks,
have the kindness to explain....  Major
Topham, explain to these gentlemen that I
have come out to fight, sir, and that fight I
will, by the living jingo!"  He struck the arm
of the chair in his fury, gave his suffering foot
a nasty jar and burst into a howl of rage and
agony.
</p>

<p>
"Stap me," said Stafford, "I'd as soon fight
an old bear!  Whisper, Foulks, is he going
to shoot in his cage&mdash;beg pardon, I mean his
chair?"
</p>

<p>
"Such is his intention," said Mr. Foulks,
grinning nervously as he spoke, and showing
the set of fine Bond Street ivory already
referred to by Mr. Stafford.  "But it strikes me
it is somewhat irregular."
</p>

<p>
"Somewhat irregular?" ejaculated Lord
Markham; "it is altogether irregular.  I
decline to have anything to say to it."
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper remained standing, gloomily looking
at the ground and driving his gold-headed
malacca into the soft mud as if all his attention
were directed to the making of a row of little
tunnels.
</p>

<p>
"What is the difficulty, what is the difficulty?"
bellowed Colonel Villiers.  "You wheel me
into position, and you mark the paces, eight
paces, Foulks, not a foot more, and you give
me my pistol.  What is the difficulty&mdash;hang
me, hang you all, I say!  What <i>is</i> the
difficulty?"
</p>

<p>
"The combatants will not be equal," suggested
Major Topham.  "I told Villiers that I
will gladly take his place."
</p>

<p>
"No no, no!" screamed the old man turning
round, and then, "Oh," cried he, and screwed
up his face.  And then the gout had him with
such fury that he gripped the arms of his chair
and flung back his head, displaying a ghastly
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"I remember," champed old Foulks, "the
dear Duke of Darlington insisted upon fighting
Basil Verney (that's Verney's father, you know)
with his left arm in splints, but as my Lord
Marquis of Cranbroke, his Grace's second,
remarked to me at the time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, spare us the Marquis!" interrupted
Stafford brutally.  "Let us keep to the business
on hand, if you please.  The whole thing is
absurd, monstrous!  Look here, Jasper, look
here, Colonel, you two cannot fight to-day.
How could you be equally matched even if we
got another bath-chair for Jasper.  We cannot
give him the gout, man, and 'twould be too
dashed unfair.  Gad, Colonel you would shoot
too well or too ill, 'twon't do!  Come, come,
gentlemen, let us make a good business out of
a bad one.  Why should you fight at all?
Here's Jasper willing to apologise.  (Yes
you are, Jasper, hold your tongue and be
sensible for once; you pulled off his wig, you
know.  Gad, it was not pretty behaviour, not
at all pretty!)  But then, Colonel, did not he
think you had cut him out with his wife, and
was not that a compliment?  The neatest
compliment you'll ever have this side the grave!
He was jealous of you, Colonel; faith, I don't
know another man in Bath that would do you
so much honour, now-a-days."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, take me out of this," cried the Colonel,
suddenly giving way to the physical anguish
that he had been struggling against so
valiantly.  "Zounds, I will fight you all some day!
Take me out of this.  Where is that brimstone
idiot, my servant?  Take me out of this, you
devils!"
</p>

<p>
Between them they wheeled his chair into
the road and his screams and curses as he was
lifted into the coach were terrible to hear.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, if he could but call out the gout!"
cried Stafford.  "Look at him, gentlemen!
Ha, he has got his footman by the periwig!
Oh, 'tis as good as a play, he is laying it on to
the fellow like a Trojan!  Why, the poor devil
has escaped, but his wig is in the Colonel's
hands.  Ha, ha, he has sent it flying out of the
coach!  Off they go; what a voice the old boy
has got, he is trumpeting like the elephant at
the fair!  Well, Jasper, what did I say?  No
duel to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Do not make so sure of that," said Sir
Jasper.  He was moving towards the curricle
as he spoke, and turned a sinister face over his
shoulder to his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried the latter, and fell back upon
Markham, "the fellow's look would turn a
churn-full of cream!  No, I will not drive back
with ye, thankye, Sir Jasper; I will walk.
Devil take it," said Stafford, "I don't mind a
little jealousy in reason myself; but if I were
to drive home in that company, I'd have no
appetite for dinner.  Come, gentlemen, 'tis a
lovely day, let us walk."
</p>

<p>
So Sir Jasper rolled home alone, and, as his
coachman observed a little later as he helped
to unharness the sweating horses, "drove them
cruel!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
SCENE XI
</h3>

<p>
Lady Standish was one of those clinging
beings who seem morally and physically to be
always seeking a prop.  Before adversity she
was prostrate, and when his lordship the
Bishop of Bath and Wells was ushered into
her sitting-room, half-an-hour after Sir Jasper's
departure for Hammer's Fields, he found the
poor lady stretched all her length upon the
sofa, her head buried in the cushions.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," said his lordship, and paused.
He was a tall, portly, handsome gentleman
with sleek countenance, full eye, and
well-defined waistcoat.  Could human weakness have
touched him, he would have felt a pride in those
legs which so roundly filled the silk stockings.
But that human weakness could ever affect
the Bishop of Bath and Wells was a thing
that dignitary (and he gave his Maker thanks
for it) felt to be utterly inconceivable.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Standish," said the Bishop; then he
waved his hand to the curious servants.
"Leave us, leave us, friends," said he.
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish reared herself with a sort of
desperate heart-sickness into a sitting posture
and turned her head to look dully upon her
visitor.
</p>

<p>
"You come too late," she said; "my lord.
Sir Jasper has gone to this most disastrous
meeting."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lady Standish," said Dr. Thurlow,
"my dear child," he took a chair and
drew it to the sofa, and then lifted her slight
languid hand and held it between his two
plump palms.  "My dear Lady Standish,"
pursued he in a purring, soothing tone.  If
he did not know how to deal with an afflicted
soul (especially if that afflicted soul happened
to belong to the aristocracy and in preference
inhabited a young female body), who did?
"I came upon the very moment I received
your letter.  I might perhaps have instantly
done something to help in this matter, had
you been more explicit, but there was a
slight incoherence ... very natural!"  Here
he patted her hand gently.  "A slight
incoherence which required explanations.  Now
tell me&mdash;I gather that your worthy husband
has set forth upon an affair of honour, eh?
Shall we say a duel?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish gave a moaning assent.
</p>

<p>
"Some trifling quarrel.  Hot-headed young
men!  It is very reprehensible, but we must
not be too hard on young blood.  Young
blood is hot!  Well, well, trust in a merciful
Providence, my dear Lady Standish.  You
know, not a sparrow falls, not a hair of our
heads, that is not counted.  Was the,
ah&mdash;quarrel about cards, or some such social
trifle?"
</p>

<p>
"It was about me," said the afflicted wife
in a strangled voice.
</p>

<p>
"About you, my dear lady!"  The clasp
of the plump hand grew, if possible, a trifle
closer, almost tender.  Lady Standish was
cold and miserable, this warm touch conveyed
somehow a vague feeling of strength and
comfort.
</p>

<p>
"About me," she repeated, and her lip
trembled.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, is it so?  And with whom does Sir
Jasper fight?"
</p>

<p>
"With Colonel Villiers," said she, and shot
a glance of full misery into the benign
large-featured face bending over her.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Villiers," repeated the Bishop in
tones of the blankest astonishment.  "Not&mdash;eh,
not&mdash;er, old Colonel Villiers?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my lord," cried Lady Standish, "I
am the most miserable and the most innocent
of women!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear madam," cried the Bishop, "I
never for an instant doubted the latter."  His
hold upon her hand relaxed, and she withdrew
it to push away the tears that now began
to gather thick and fast on her eyelashes.
The Bishop wondered how it was he had
never noticed before what a very pretty woman
Lady Standish was, what charming eyes she
had, and what quite unusually long eyelashes.
It was something of a revelation to him too,
to see so fair and fine a skin in these days
of rouge and powder.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," sobbed Lady Standish, "'tis
my fault too, for I have been very wrong,
very foolish!  Oh, my lord, if my husband
is hurt, I cannot deny 'tis I shall bear the
guilt of it."
</p>

<p>
"Come, tell me all about it," said the
Bishop, and edged from his chair to her side
on the sofa, and re-possessed himself of her
hand.  She let it lie in his; she was very
confiding.  "We are all foolish," said
Dr. Thurlow, "we are all, alas, prone to sin."
He spoke in the plural to give her confidence,
not that such a remark could apply to any
Bishop of Bath and Wells.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have been very foolish," repeated
the lady.  "I thought, my lord, I fancied that
my husband's affection for me was waning."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" cried his lordship.  But he
felt slightly bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"And so, acting upon inconsiderate advice,
I&mdash;I pretended&mdash;only pretended indeed, my
lord&mdash;that I cared for someone else, and Sir
Jasper got jealous and so he has been calling
everybody out thinking that he has a rival."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," said the Bishop, "he has
no rival.  Do I understand you correctly, my
dear child?  These suspicions of his are
unfounded?  Colonel Villiers?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Villiers," cried she, "that old stupid
red-nosed wretch!  No, my lord, indeed, there
is no one.  My husband has my whole heart!"  She
caught her breath and looked up at him
with candid eyes swimming in the most attractive
tears.  "Colonel Villiers!" cried she.
"Oh, how can you think such a thing of me?
But my husband will not believe me; indeed,
indeed, indeed I am innocent!  He was jealous
of Lord Verney too, and last night fought
Mr. O'Hara."
</p>

<p>
The Bishop smiled to himself with the
most benign indulgence.  His was a soul
overflowing with charity, but it was chiefly
when dealing with the foibles of a pretty
woman that he appreciated to the full what
a truly inspired ordinance that of charity is.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, if I may call you so,
knowing your worthy mother so well, you
must not grieve like this.  Let me feel that
you look upon me as a friend.  Let me wipe
away these tears.  Why, you are trembling!
Shall we not have more trust in the ruling
of a merciful Heaven?  Now I am confident
that Sir Jasper will be restored to you
uninjured or with but a trifling injury.  And if
I may so advise, do not seek, my dear Lady
Standish, in the future to provoke his jealousy
in this manner; do not openly do anything
which will arouse those evil passions of anger
and vengeance in him!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, indeed, indeed," she cried, and placed
her other little hand timidly upon the
comforting clasp of the Bishop's, "indeed I never
will again!"
</p>

<p>
"And remember that in me you have a
true friend, my dear Lady Standish.  Allow
me to call myself your friend."
</p>

<p>
Here there came a sound of flying wheels
and frantic hoofs without, and the door-bell
was pealed and the knocker plied so that the
summons echoed and re-echoed through the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God!" screamed Lady Standish
springing to her feet, "they have returned!
Oh, heavens, what has happened?  If he is
hurt I cannot bear it, I cannot&mdash;I cannot!"  She
clasped her head wildly and swayed as
if she would have fallen.  What could a
Christian do, a gentleman and a shepherd of
souls, but catch her lest she fall?  Half mad
with terror she turned and clung to him as
she would have clung to the nearest support.
</p>

<p>
"Have courage," he purred into the little
ear; "I am with you, dear child, have courage."
</p>

<p>
So they stood, she clasping the Bishop and
the Bishop clasping her, patting her shoulder,
whispering in her ear, when Sir Jasper burst
in upon them.
</p>

<p>
It was his voice that drove them apart, yet
it was neither loud nor fierce, it was only
blightingly sarcastic.
</p>

<p>
"So!" said he.
</p>

<p>
What was it Stafford had said: "There's
the Bishop of Bath and Wells.  He's red,
as red as a lobster, from top to toe!  They
have a way, these divines."  Oh, Stafford
knew doubtless: all Bath knew!  Sir Jasper
cursed horribly in his heart, but aloud only
said: "So!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish flew half across the room
to him with a joyful cry, but was arrested
midway by his attitude, his look.  The Bishop
said "Ahem," and "ahem" again, and then
said he:
</p>

<p>
"I rejoice, I rejoice, Sir Jasper, to see you
return unscathed.  Lady Standish has been
greatly distressed."
</p>

<p>
"And you," said Sir Jasper, drily, "have
been consoling her."
</p>

<p>
"To the best of my poor power," said the
Bishop, and felt, he knew not why (if indeed
it were possible for him to feel that way!)
a shade uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper closed the door and bowed.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said he, "I ought to crave
pardon for this intrusion."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Jasper!" cried my lady.
</p>

<p>
Her husband turned towards her for a
second.  She wilted beneath his eye and
sank into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sir Jasper," said she, floundering.
"The Bishop has been very kind.  I have
been so unhappy about you."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Sir Jasper, "that his lordship
has been very kind.  His lordship, as I said,
has been administering consolation."
</p>

<p>
Here all at once his stoniness gave way.
He walked towards the Bishop and bent a
ghastly face close to the florid uneasily smiling
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord," said Sir Jasper, "your cloth
will not protect you."
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" ejaculated the divine.
</p>

<p>
"Your cloth will not protect you!" repeated
Sir Jasper in that voice of strenuous
composure that seems to tremble on a shriek.
"Oh, shepherd, <i>you</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" cried the Bishop, "do you mean to
insinuate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I insinuate nothing," cried the other and
sneered.  "So madam," he turned again to
his wife, "this is your choice, eh?  You were
always a pious woman, were you not?  You
would like to have the approval of the Church
upon your acts, would you not?"  Indescribable
was the sarcasm upon his lip.
</p>

<p>
"Really," said the Bishop, "I am seriously
annoyed."  He looked reproachfully at Lady
Standish.  "Madam," said he, "I came to
you, as you know, in pure charity, in
unsuspecting friendship.  I was not prepared
for this."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha," said Sir Jasper with a hideous
laugh.  "No, sir, I have no doubt you were
not prepared for this.  Pure, ha&mdash;unsuspecting&mdash;this
is pleasant!  Be silent, madam, these
groans, these crocodile tears have no effect
upon me.  Come, my Lord Bishop, your
sanctimonious airs cannot take me in.  Have
I not read your letter?  Oh, you have got a
very fine head of hair, but I know ... <i>there
is a curl missing</i>!  Ha, Julia, you should take
better care of your love-tokens."
</p>

<p>
"I vow," said Dr.  Thurlow, majestically,
"that your behaviour, your words are quite
beyond my poor comprehension.&mdash;Madam, I
pity you from my heart!&mdash;Sir Jasper, sir,"
folding his arms fiercely, "your servant.  I
wish you good-morning."  He strode to the
door, his fine legs quivering with indignation
beneath their purple silk meshes.
</p>

<p>
"No!" said Sir Jasper, and seized him
roughly by the skirts.  "No, you do not
escape me thus!"
</p>

<p>
"How now!" cried the Bishop, the veins
on his forehead swelling, and the nostrils of
his handsome Roman nose dilating.  "Would
you lay hands upon the Lord's anointed?  Let
go my coat, Sir Jasper!"
</p>

<p>
He struck at Sir Jasper's retaining hand
with his own plump fist clenched in a fashion
suggestive of pulpit eloquence.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! you would, would you?" exclaimed
Sir Jasper, and leaped at the Episcopal throat.
</p>

<p>
The next instant, to his intense astonishment,
Sir Jasper found himself in an iron
grip; lifted into the air with an ease against
which all his resistance was as that of a
puppet; shaken till his teeth rattled, and
deposited on the flat of his back upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, help, help, help!" screamed Lady
Standish.
</p>

<p>
"Really," said the Bishop, "I don't know
when I have been so insulted in my life.
'Tis the whole Church, sir, the Church of
England, the State itself, that you have
assaulted in my person!"
</p>

<p>
He stood glaring down on the prostrate
foe, breathing heavy rebuke through his high
dignified nose.
</p>

<p>
"You have committed blasphemy, simony,
sacrilege, rank sacrilege," thundered Dr. Thurlow.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper gathered himself together like a
panther, and sprang to his feet; like a panther,
too, he took two or three stealthy steps and,
half crouching, measured the muscular Bishop
with bloodshot eyes, selecting the most
vulnerable portion of anatomy.  He panted and
foamed.  The air was thick with flying powder.
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish flung herself between them.
</p>

<p>
"In mercy, my lord," she cried, "leave
us&mdash;leave us!"
</p>

<p>
Here the door opened and butler and
delighted footmen burst into the room.
</p>

<p>
The Bishop turned slowly.  The grace of
his vocation prevailed over the mere man.
</p>

<p>
"May heaven pardon you," he said.  "May
Heaven pardon you, sir, and help you to
chasten this gross violence of temper.  And you,
madam," said he, turning witheringly upon the
unfortunate and long-suffering lady, "may you
learn womanly decorum and circumspection!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear from me again," growled
Sir Jasper, murderously&mdash;"Toombs," cried he
to the butler with a snarl, "show the Bishop
the door!"
</p>

<p>
The Bishop smiled.  He wheeled upon them
all a stately back, and with short deliberate
steps withdrew, taking his cane from the
footman with a glassy look that petrified Thomas,
and refusing Mr. Toombs' proffered ministrations
as he might have waved aside a cup of
poison.  "<i>Vade retro Satanas</i>," he seemed to
say; and so departed, leaving his pastoral curse
voicelessly behind him.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE XII
</h3>

<p>
"How beautiful you are!" said Lord Verney.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting on a stool at Mrs. Bellairs'
feet.  She had abandoned to him one plump
taper-fingered hand.  The gay little parlour
of the Queen Square house was full of sunshine
and of the screeching ecstasy of Mistress
Kitty's canary bird.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful you are!" said he; it was
for the fourth time within the half-hour.
Conversation between them had languished somehow.
</p>

<p>
Kitty Bellairs flung a sidelong wistful look
upon her lover's countenance.  His eyes, gazing
upwards upon her, devoured her beauty with
the self-same expression that she had found
so entrancing earlier in the day.  "Deep
wells of passion," she had told herself then.
Now a chill shade of misgiving crept upon
her.
</p>

<p>
"His eyes are like a calf's," she said to
herself suddenly.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful&mdash;&mdash;" thus he began to
murmur once again, when his mistress's little
hand, twitching impatiently from his grasp,
surprised him into silence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear! a calf in very truth," thought
she.  "Baah&mdash;baa ooh....  What can I have
seen in him?  'Twas a sudden pastoral yearning....!"
</p>

<p>
"May I not hold your hand?" said he,
shifting himself to his silken knees and pressing
against her.
</p>

<p>
Yet he was a pretty boy and there was a
charm undoubted in the freshness of this
innocence and youth awakening to the first
glimmer of man's passion.
</p>

<p>
"Delightful task&mdash;&mdash;" she quoted under her
breath, and once more vouchsafed him, with
a sweep like the poise of a dove, her gentle
hand.
</p>

<p>
As it lay in his brown fingers, she contemplated
it with artistic satisfaction and played
her little digits up and down, admiring the
shape and colour of the nails, the delicate
dimples at the knuckles.  But Lord Verney's
great boy's paw engulfed them all too quickly,
and his brown eyes never wavered from their
devout contemplation of her countenance.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty sprang to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"I vow," she cried, "'tis my hour for the
waters, and I had clean forgot them!"
</p>

<p>
She called upon her maid:
</p>

<p>
"Lydia, child, my hat!&mdash;Lord Verney, if it
please you, sir, your arm as far as the Pump
Room."  ("At least," she thought to herself,
"all Bath shall know of my latest conquest")
</p>

<p>
She tied her hat ribbons under her chin.
</p>

<p>
"How like you the mode?" said she.  And,
charmed into smiles again by the rosy vision
under the black plumes, she flashed round upon
him from the mirror.  "Is it not, perhaps, a
thought fly-away?  Yet 'tis the latest.  What
says my Verney?"
</p>

<p>
The poor youth vainly endeavoured to
discriminate and criticise.
</p>

<p>
"It is indeed a very fine hat," said he
... "and there seem to be a vast number of
feathers upon it."  He hesitated, stammered.
"Oh, what care I for modes!  'Tis you, you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What are you staring at, girl?" cried
Mistress Bellairs sharply, to her Abigail.  "Out
with you!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my Verney?" said she.  "Mercy,
how you look, man!  Is anything wrong with
my face?"
</p>

<p>
She tilted that lovely little piece of perishable
bloom innocently towards him as she spoke.
And the kiss she had read in his eyes landed
with unprecedented success upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Why, who knows?" thought she, with a
little satisfied smile, as she straightened her
modish hat.  "There may be stuff in the
lad, after all!"
</p>

<p>
She took his arm.  Dazed by his own
audacity, he suffered her to lead him from
the room.  They jostled together down the
narrow stairs.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful you are!" said he; and
kissed her again as they reached the sombre
dark-panelled vestibule.
</p>

<p>
"Fie!" said she with a shade of testiness
and pushed him back, as her little black page
ran to open the door.
</p>

<p>
The kiss, like his talk, lacked any heightening
of tone&mdash;and what of a lover's kiss that
shows no new ardour, what of a vow of love
that has no new colour, no fresh imagery?
But the trees in Queen Square were lightly
leafed with pale, golden-green.  The sunshine
was white-gold, the breeze fresh and laughing;
the old grey town was decked as with garlands
of Young Love.
</p>

<p>
"He is but new to it," she argued against
her fleeting doubts, "and he is, sure, the
prettiest youth in all Bath."
</p>

<p>
Love and Spring danced in Mistress Kitty's
light heart and light heels as she tripped
forth.  And Love and Spring gathered and
strove and sought outlet in Verney's soul as
inevitably, and irresistibly, and almost as
unconsciously as the sap in the young shoots
that swayed under the caress of the breeze
and amorously unfurled themselves to the sunlight.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
The Pump Room was cool and dim after
the grey stone street upon which the young
year's sunshine beat as fierce as its youth
knew how.  The water droned its little song
as it welled up, faintly steaming.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to it," quoth Mistress Kitty.  "How
innocent it sounds, how dear it looks!"
</p>

<p>
With a smile she took the glass transferred
to her by Verney, and: "Ugh!" said she,
"how monstrous horrid it tastes, to be sure!
'Tis, I fear," she said, again casting a glance
of some anxiety at her new lover's countenance,
"a symbol of life."
</p>

<p>
"Yet," said he, "these waters are said to
be vastly wholesome."
</p>

<p>
"Wholesome!" cried Mistress Kitty, sipping
again, and again curling her nose upwards
and the corners of her lips downwards, in an
irresistibly fascinating grimace.  "Wholesome,
my lord!  Heaven defend us!  And what is
that but the last drop to complete their
odiousness!  Wholesome, sir?  I would have you
know 'tis not for wholesomeness I drink."  She
put down her glass, undiminished save by the
value of a bird's draught.  "Do I look like
a woman who needs to drink waters for
'wholesomeness?'"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, no," floundered he in his bewildered
way.
</p>

<p>
"There are social obligations," said she,
sententiously.  "A widow, sir, alone and
unprotected, <i>must</i> conform to common usage.
And then I have another reason, one of pure
sentiment."
</p>

<p>
She cocked her head and fixed her mocking
eye upon him.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Bellairs," said she, "how oft has
it not been my pleasure and my duty to fill
such a glass as this and convey it to his lips?
In his last years, poor angel, he had quite lost
the use of his limbs!"
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney had no answer appropriate to
these tender reminiscences; and Mistress Kitty,
having, it seemed, sufficiently conformed to the
usage of Bath, as well as sacrificed to the
manes of the departed, turned briskly round,
and, leaning against a pilaster, began to survey
the room.
</p>

<p>
"La! how empty!" quoth she.  "'Tis your
fault if I am so late, my lord.  Nobody, I
swear, but that Flyte woman, your odious
Spicer, sir&mdash;ha, and old General Tilney.
Verily, I believe these dreadful springs have
the power of keeping such mummies in life
long after their proper limit.  'Tis hardly fair
on the rest of the world.  Why, the poor
thing has scarce a sense or a wit left, and yet
it walks!  Heaven preserve us! why, it runs!"
she cried suddenly with a little chirp, as the
unfortunate veteran of Dettingen, escaping
from the guiding hands of his chairman, started
for the door with the uncontrolled trot of
semi-paralytic senility.
</p>

<p>
"And that reminds me," said Mistress Kitty,
"that Sir George is most particular that I
should walk five minutes between every glass.
Here comes your estimable aunt, Lady Maria,
and her ear-trumpet, and the unfortunate Miss
Selina.  I protest, with that yellow feather
she is more like my dear dead Toto than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Was that your pet name for your husband?"
murmured Lord Verney, in a strangled
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Fie, sir!" cried the widow.  "My cockatoo&mdash;I
referred to my cockatoo."  She sighed
profoundly.  "I loved him," she said.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, uncertain to which of
the lamented bipeds she referred.
</p>

<p>
"Selina," cried Lady Maria, in the strident
tones of the deaf woman persuaded of her
own consequence (the voice of your shy deaf
one loses all sound in her terror of being
loud)&mdash;"Selina, how often must I tell you
that you must clip in my glass yourself!  Who's
that over there?  Where are my eyeglasses?
Who's that, did you say?  Mistress Bellairs?
Humph!  And who's she got with her in tow
now?  Who did you say?  Louder, child,
louder.  What makes you mumble so?  Who?
Verney&mdash;Lord Verney?  Why, that's my
nevvy.  Tell him to come to me this minute.
Do you hear, Selina, this minute!  I won't
have him fall into the net of widow Bellairs!"
</p>

<p>
The cockatoo top-knot nodded vehemently.
Poor Miss Selina, agitated between consciousness
that the whole Pump Room was echoing
to Lady Maria's sentiments and terror of her
patroness, took two steps upon her errand,
and halted, fluttering.  Lord Verney had
flushed darkly purple.  Mistress Kitty hung
with yet more affectionate weight upon his
arm and smiled with sweet unconsciousness.
For the moment she was as deaf as Lady
Maria.
</p>

<p>
The latter's claw-like hand had now
disengaged a long-stemmed eyeglass from her
laces.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis indeed," she pronounced in her
commanding bass, "my nevvy Verney with that
vile Bellairs!&mdash;-Nevvy!  Here, I say!&mdash;Selina,
fool, have you gone to sleep?"
</p>

<p>
An echo, as of titters, began to circle round
the Pump Room.  The painted face of Lady
Flyte was wreathed into a smile of peculiar
significance, as she whispered over her glass
to her particular friend of the moment, Captain
Spicer.  This gentleman's pallid visage was
illumined with a radiance of gratified spite.
His lips were pursed as though upon a
plum of superdelicious gossip.  He began to
whisper and mouthe.  Young Squire Greene
approached the couple with an eager ear and
an innocent noddy face that strove to look
vastly wise.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you," mouthed the Captain.  "Was
I not there?"
</p>

<p>
"In his bedroom?" cried Lady Flyte, with
a shrill laugh.
</p>

<p>
Lady Maria's cockatoo crest rose more
fiercely.  It seemed to Kitty Bellairs as if
she heard the old lady's jaws rattle.  It was
certain that in her wrath she squawked louder
than even the late lamented Toto.  Then
Mistress Kitty, who, to say the truth, began
to find the scene a little beyond enjoyment,
felt the young arm upon which she leaned
stiffen, the young figure beside her rear itself
with a new manliness.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mistress Bellairs," said my Lord
Verney, he spoke loudly and, to her surprise,
with perfect facility, even dignity, "will you
allow me to introduce you to my aunt, Lady
Maria Prideaux?&mdash;Aunt Maria," said he, and
his voice rang out finely, imposing a general
silence, "let me present Mistress Bellairs.
This lady has graciously condescended to
accept me as her future husband.  I am
the happiest and the most honoured of men."
</p>

<p>
The last sentence he cried out still more
emphatically than the rest, and then repeated
it with his eye on Kitty's suddenly flushed
cheek, almost in a whisper and with a quiver
of strong emotion.
</p>

<p>
The astounded Mistress Kitty rose from her
deep curtesy with a swelling heart.
</p>

<p>
"The dear lad," she said to herself.  "The
dear, innocent chivalrous lad!"
</p>

<p>
There was almost a dimness in her brilliant
black eye.  Her emotion was of a kind she had
never known before: it was almost maternal.
</p>

<p>
Under stress of sudden genuine emotion,
the wit of intrigue in the cleverest woman
falls in abeyance.  Mistress Bellairs found no
word out of the new situation.
</p>

<p>
Lady Maria's deafness had increased to an
alarming extent.
</p>

<p>
"Gratified, I'm sure," she mumbled, stuck
out her dry hand and withdrew it before
Mistress Bellairs had time to touch it.
</p>

<p>
"My future wife," bawled the budding peer,
in his aged relative's ear.
</p>

<p>
It was curious to note how old Lady Maria
seemed suddenly to have become.  Huddled
in herself she nodded vacantly at her nephew.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye for asking, child," said she, "but
the waters try me a good deal."
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney attempted another shout in vain.
</p>

<p>
"So Sir George says," remarked my lady.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the very eye of my poor dear Toto,"
thought Mistress Bellairs.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney looked round in despair.  Miss
Selina thought him monstrous handsome and
gallant, and her poor old-maid's heart warmed
to the lover in him.  She approached Lady
Maria and gently lifted her trumpet.
</p>

<p>
Lady Maria, glad enough of a diversion,
applied it to her ear with unwonted affability.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, my dear?  Any sign of the
Duchess?"
</p>

<p>
"Your nephew," said Miss Selina in modest
accents, "your nephew, my Lord Verney,
wishes to inform you that he is about to
contract a matrimonial alliance with the lady he
has just introduced to you."
</p>

<p>
Miss Selina blushed behind the mouthpiece
as she made this announcement.  Then she
cried: "Oh," with an accent of suffering, for
Lady Maria had rapped her over the knuckles
with the instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Matrimonial fiddlesticks!" said Lord Verney's
aunt.  "Selina, you're a perfect fool!&mdash;Madam,"
remarked the wraith of the departed
cockatoo, inclining her crest with much dignity
towards the blooming Kitty, "I wish you good-morning."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XIII
</h3>

<p>
There must have been a curious magic in
the words, "My future wife," for no sooner
had he pronounced them than Lord Verney
became several inches taller, a distinct span
broader and quite unreasonably older.  In
fact, from boyhood he had stepped to man's
estate.  He looked down protectingly at the
little woman hanging on his arm.  The seriousness
of responsibility settled upon his brow.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Verney," quoth Mr. Stafford, flicking
a hot brow, as he dashed in out of the
sunshine, powdered with white dust from his
walk and still bubbling with laughter.  "Ah,
Verney, playing butterfly in the golden hours
while other fellows toil in the sweat of their
brow!  Jingo! lad, but you've lit on the very
rose of the garden.&mdash;Mistress Kitty Bellairs,
I kiss your hand."
</p>

<p>
At this Mistress Kitty felt her future lord's
arm press her fingers to his ribs, while he
straightened his youthful back.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stafford," began he in solemn tones,
"this lady&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But she, knowing what was coming, interrupted
ruthlessly.
</p>

<p>
"And pray, Mr. Stafford," quoth she, cocking
her head at him with those birdlike airs and
graces that were as natural to her as to any
mincing dove&mdash;Mistress Kitty being of those
that begin by making eyes in their nurses' arms,
before they can speak, and end in a modish
lace nightcap for the benefit of the doctor&mdash;"and
whence may you come so late, and thus
heated?"
</p>

<p>
"Whence?" cried Mr. Stafford, and overcome
by the humour of his recollections, roused
the solemn echoes of the Pump Room by his
jovial laugh.  "Ah, you may well ask! from
the merriest meeting it has ever been my fate
to attend.  Oh, the face of him in his chair,
between his gout and his temper!  And fire-eating
Jasper all for bullets; and old Foulks'
teeth ready to drop out of his head at the
indecorousness of it all!&mdash;Spicer, man,
aha! hold me up.&mdash;Oh, madam," cried Mr. Stafford,
wiping tears of ecstasy from his eyes and leaning
as unceremoniously against Spicer as if the
latter's lank figure were a pilaster specially
intended for his support&mdash;"oh, madam, I could
make you laugh had I the breath left for it."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," cried Mistress Kitty, plunging in
again, as it became evident to her that Lord
Verney, with the gentle obstinacy that was part
of his character, was once more preparing to
make his nuptial statement.  "Mr. Stafford,
please speak then, for in sooth it seems to me
a vastly long time since I have laughed."
</p>

<p>
"Gad! you actually make me curious," put
in Mr. Stafford's prop.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, oh dear!" sighed Mr. Stafford,
in a fresh fit, "ha, ha!  By the way, Verney,
weren't you also to have walked with the
jealous husband this morning!&mdash;Ah, by the same
token, and you too, Spicer?  Gad.  I'm glad
you didn't, for if either of you had put lead in
him I'd have missed the best joke of the season.
Gad, I may say so.  He, he, aha-ha, ho, ho!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stafford," said my Lord Verney, as
solemn as any owl, while Mistress Kitty, caught
by the infection of the genial Stafford's mirth,
tittered upon his arm, "I have deeper reason
than you think of to rejoice that the absurd
misunderstanding was cleared up between Sir
Jasper and myself.  This lady and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, the joke, the joke!" cried Mistress
Bellairs, with loud impatience, and stamped her
little foot.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my fair Bellairs," gasped Mr. Stafford,
"had you but been there to share it with me!"
</p>

<p>
"This lady&mdash;&mdash;" quoth Lord Verney.
</p>

<p>
"I wish indeed I had been!" cried she.  And
in very truth she did.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Bellairs," said the determined lover,
"has consented to make me the happiest of men."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" cried Mr. Stafford, and stopped on
the edge of another guffaw.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty cast down her eyelids.  She
felt she looked demure and almost bashful,
and she hated herself in this character.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stafford was one of the thirty-seven
lovers of whom the lady had spoken so
confidently, and as such was far from realising the
solemn meaning of Lord Verney's announcement.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madam," cried he reproachfully, "is't
not enough to keep me for ever in Hades,
must you needs add to my torture by showing
me another in Paradise?  But, my little Verney,"
he went on, turning good-naturedly to his
young rival, "it is but fair to warn you that
you will be wise to pause before getting
yourself measured for your halo: the Paradise of
this lady's favour is (alack, do I not know it?)
of most precarious tenure."
</p>

<p>
"This lady, sir," said Lord Verney, with
rigid lips, "has promised to be my wife."
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate that Mr. Stafford had a
prop: under the shock he staggered.  Man of
the world as he was, the most guileless
astonishment was stamped on his countenance.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how demure looked Mistress Kitty!
</p>

<p>
Spicer, a trifle yellow, became effusive in
congratulations which were but coldly received
by his patron.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Kitty," whispered Mr. Stafford in
Mistress Bellairs' shell-like ear, "do you like
them so tender-green?  Why, my dear, the
lad's chin is as smooth as your own.  What
pleasantry is this?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty scraped her little foot and hung her
head.  Mistress Kitty coy!  And yon poor
innocent with his air of proprietorship&mdash;'twas
a most humorous spectacle!
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure, Verney," cried Mr. Stafford, "I
wish you joy, ha, ha! with all my heart!  And
you madam, he, he!&mdash;forgive me, friends&mdash;the
thought of Sir Jasper's duel is still too much
for me.  Ha, ha!  Support me, Spicer."
</p>

<p>
"She'll marry him, she'll marry him," cried
Spicer with bilious vindictiveness, looking over
his shoulder at the couple, as they moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Marry him!&mdash;never she!" cried Stafford.
"Kitty's no fool.  Why, man, the little demon
wouldn't have <i>me</i>!  She loves her liberty and
her pleasures too well.  Did you not see?
She could not look up for fear of showing the
devilment in her eye.  Cheerily, cheerily, my
gallant Captain!" cried the spark, and struck
the reedy shoulders that had buttressed him, in
contemptuous good-natured valediction.  "You
need not yet cast about for a new greenhorn
to subsist upon."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty, glancing up at her Calf,
found, something to her astonishment and
further displeasure, a new expression in his
eyes.  Ardour had been superseded by an
unseasonable gravity.
</p>

<p>
"The creature is a complete menagerie!"
she thought to herself, indignantly.  "I vow
he looks like nothing but an owl in the
twilight!"
</p>

<p>
They wandered together from the Pump
Room on to the Abbey Flags, and so, slowly,
into the cool and shady Orange Grove; and
in a sequestered spot they sat them down on
a stone bench.
</p>

<p>
"When a man," said he, "has been, as I
have, brought face to face, within the space
of one short morning, with the great events
of existence, Death and Love, how hollow and
how unworthy do the mock joys and griefs
of Society appear to him!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh la!" said she.  "You alarm me.  And
when did you see Death, my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said he, with his innocent gravity,
"had you not intervened, my dearest dear,
between Sir Jasper and me, this morning, who
knows what might have happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that!" said she, and her lip curled.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said he, "where should I be now,
Kitty?  The thought haunts me in the midst
of my great happiness.  Had I killed Sir
Jasper, could I have looked upon myself other
than as a murderer?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fie, fie," interpolated his mistress
impatiently, "who ever thinks of such things in
little matters of honour!"
</p>

<p>
In her heart she told herself that the young
man showed a prodigious want of <i>savoir-vivre</i>.
In all candour he proceeded to display a still
greater lack of that convenient quality.
</p>

<p>
"On the other hand, had I fallen, and that
indeed was the more likely contingency, it
being my first affair of the kind, I tremble to
think in what state my soul would have
appeared before its Maker."  His voice quivered
a moment.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord Verney," cried Kitty, turning
upon him a most distressed countenance, "you
have no idea how you shock me!"
</p>

<p>
And indeed he had not.
</p>

<p>
He took her distress for the sweetest
womanly sympathy, and was emboldened to
further confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I blush to tell you," he said, "that since
I came to this gay Society of Bath, my life
has not been all my conscience could approve
of.  The pious practices, the earnest principles
of life so sedulously inculcated in me
by my dear mother, have been but too easily
cast aside."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" cried Kitty in accents of yet
greater pain.
</p>

<p>
"When we are married, my dear love,"
pursued Lord Verney, quietly encircling his
mistress's little waist with his arm as he spoke,
but, absorbed as he was in his virtuous
reflections, omitting to infuse any ardour into
his embrace, "we shall not seek the brilliant
world.  We shall find all our happiness with
each other, shall we not?  Oh, how welcome
my dear mother will make you at Verney
Hall!  It has always been her dream that I
should marry early and settle on the estate."
</p>

<p>
Little shivers ran down Kitty's spine.  "Is
it your intention to live with your mother
when you are married?" she faltered, and
leaned weakly against the inert arm.
</p>

<p>
Enthusiastically he cried that the best of
mothers and he could never be parted long.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how you will love her!" he said,
looking fondly at the Kitty of his imagination.
</p>

<p>
"From your tenderest years she sedulously
inculcated in you earnest principles and pious
practices, did she not?" murmured the Kitty
of reality, with what was almost a moan.
</p>

<p>
"She did indeed," cried the youth.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty closed her eyes and let her
head droop upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I fear I am going to have the vapours,"
said she.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis, maybe, the spring heats," said he,
and made as if he would rise.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," said Mistress Kitty, becoming so
limp all at once that he was forced to tighten
his clasp.  He glanced at her now in some
alarm.  She half opened bright eyes, and
glimmered a languid little smile at him.
</p>

<p>
"At least," thought the widow, "if we must
part (and part we must, my Calf and I) we
shall part on a sweet moment.  What&mdash;in a
bower, every scent, every secret bird and leaf
and sunbeam of which calls on thought of
love, and I by his side&mdash;he to prate of his
mother!  An at least he does not bleat of my
beauty again, my name is not Kitty!"
</p>

<p>
She sighed and closed her eyes.  The delicate
face lay but a span from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"I fear indeed you are faint," said he with
solicitude.  "My mother has a sovereign
cordial against such weakness."
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs sat up very energetically
for a fainting lady.
</p>

<p>
"Your mother..." she began with a
flash of her eye, then checked herself abruptly.
"Adieu, Verney," said she, and stretched out
her hand to him.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu!" he repeated, all bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said she, "there chimes the Abbey
its silly old air.  How long have I been with
you, sir, alone?  Fie, fie, and must I not think
of my reputation?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, as my future wife..." said he.
</p>

<p>
"Why then the more reason," she said,
cutting him short; "must I not show myself
duly discreet?  Think of your lady mother!
Come, sir, take your leave."
</p>

<p>
A moment she was taunting; a moment all
delicious smiles.
</p>

<p>
"I'll make him bleat!" she thought, and
stamped her foot upon it.
</p>

<p>
"As far as your door?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Not a step," she vowed.  "Come, sir, adieu."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand; bent and kissed her
sedately.
</p>

<p>
"I will," said he, "go write the news to
my mother."
</p>

<p>
"Oh go!" said she, and turned on her heel
with a flounce and was out of his sight, round
the corner of an ally, with a whisk and flutter
of tempestuous petticoats, before his slow boy's
wits had time to claim the moment for the next
meeting.
</p>

<p>
There were actually tears in Mistress Kitty's
eyes as she struck the gravel with her cane.
She rubbed her cherry lips where his kiss had
rested with a furious hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas positively matrimonial," she cried
within herself, with angry double-threaded
reminiscence&mdash;"the Calf!  Did ever woman
spend a more ridiculous hour&mdash;and in Heaven's
name, what's to be done?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XIV
</h3>

<p>
Denis O'Hara appropriately lived in Gay
Street.  As all the world knows, Gay Street
runs steeply from the green exclusiveness of
Queen Square, to the lofty elegance, the
columnal solemnity of the King's Circus.
Being a locality of the most fashionable, Gay
Street was apt to be deserted enough at those
hours when Fashion, according to the unwritten
laws of Bath, foregathered in other
quarters.
</p>

<p>
Towards eight o'clock of the evening of the
day after his duel with Sir Jasper, Mr. Denis
O'Hara, seated at his open window, disconsolate
in a very gorgeous dressing-gown and
a slight fever fit, found it indeed so damnably
deserted that the sight of a sedan-chair
and two toiling chairmen coming up the
incline became quite an object of interest to
him.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure," thought he, "don't I know
it's only some old hen being joggled home to
roost, after losing sixpence and her temper at
piquet?  But what's to prevent me beguiling
myself for a bit by dreaming of some lovely
young female coming to visit me in me
misfortune?  Sure it's the rats those fellows are,
that not one of them would keep me company
to-night!  There's nobody like your dear
friends for smelling out an empty purse.
Musha!" said Mr. O'Hara, putting his head
out of the window, "if the blessed ould chair
isn't stopping at me own door!"
</p>

<p>
A bell pealing through the house confirmed
his observation.
</p>

<p>
"It's a woman!  By the powers, it's a
woman!  Tim, Tim, ye devil!" roared Mr. O'Hara,
"come to me this minute, or I'll brain ye."
</p>

<p>
Conscious of his invalid <i>negligé</i>, he rose in
his chair; but, curiosity proving stronger than
decorum, was unable to tear himself from his
post of vantage at the window.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! the doaty little foot!" he cried in
rapture, as arched pink-silk instep and a
brocade slipper of daintiest proportion emerged,
in a little cloud of lace, from the dim recesses
of the chair, upon his delighted vision.
</p>

<p>
He turned for a moment to bellow again
into the room:
</p>

<p>
"Tim, you limb of Satan, where are you
at all?  Sure, I'm not fit to be seen by any
lady, let alone such a foot as that!"
</p>

<p>
When he popped his head once more
through the window, only the chairmen
occupied the street.
</p>

<p>
"It's for the ground floor, of course; for
the French marquis," said O'Hara, and sat
down, feeling as flat as a pancake.
</p>

<p>
The next instant a knock at the door sent
the quick blood flying to the red head.  The
"limb of Satan," more generally known as
Tim Mahoney, an ingratiating, untidy fellow,
with a cunning leer and a coaxing manner,
stood ogling his master on the threshold; then
he jerked with his thumb several times over
his shoulder, and grinned with exquisite enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" said O'Hara fiercely.
</p>

<p>
Tim winked, and jerked his thumb once more.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, ye ugly divil, or by heavens I'll spoil
your beauty for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Your sisther!" cried Tim, with a rumbling
subterraneous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Me sisther, man?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, yer honour," said the scamp, who, as
O'Hara's foster-brother, was well aware that his
master boasted no such gentle tie.  "Sure she's
heard your honour's wounded, and she's come
to visit you.  'I'm Misther O'Hara's sister,'
says she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And am I not?" cried a sweet voice behind
him, "or, if not, at least a very, very dear
cousin, and, in any case, I must see
Mr. O'Hara at once, and alone."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure," cried O'Hara, eagerly rising
in every way to the situation, and leaping
forward.  "Show in the lady, you villain!&mdash;Oh,
my darling!" cried the Irishman,
opening generous arms, "but I am glad to see
ye!&mdash;Tim, you scoundrel, shut the door behind you!"
</p>

<p>
The visitor was much enveloped, besides
being masked.  But there was not a moment's
hesitation in the ardour of Mr. O'Hara's welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, sir!" cried a faint voice from behind
the folds of lace, "what conduct is this?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sisther darling, sure, me heart's been
hungering for you!  Another kiss, me dear,
dear cousin!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Hara!" cried Mistress Bellairs, in
tones of unmistakable indignation; tore off her
mask, and stood with panting bosom and fiery
eye.
</p>

<p>
"Tare and ages!" exclaimed the ingenuous
Irishman.  "If it isn't me lovely Kitty!"
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Bellairs, if you please, Mr. O'Hara,"
said the lady with great dignity.  "I am glad
to see, sir, that that other passion of which I
have heard so much has not interfered with the
strength of your family affections."
</p>

<p>
She sat down, and fanned herself with her
mask, and, looking haughtily round the room,
finally fixed her gaze, with much interest, upon
the left branch of the chandelier.
</p>

<p>
For a second, Mr. O'Hara's glib tongue
seemed at a loss; but it was only for a second.
With a graceful movement he gathered the
skirts of his fine-flowered damask dressing-gown
more closely over the puce satin small
clothes, which, he was sadly conscious, were
not in their first freshness, besides bearing the
trace of one over-generous bumper of what
he was fond of calling the ruby-wine.  Then,
sinking on one knee, he began to pour a tender
tale into the widow's averted ear.
</p>

<p>
"And it's the fine ninny ye must think me,
Kitty darling&mdash;I beg your pardon, darling;
ma'am it shall be, though I vow to see ye
toss your little head like that, and set all those
elegant little curls dancing, is enough to make
anyone want to start you at it again.  Oh, sure,
it's the divine little ear you have, but, be jabers,
Kitty, if it's the back of your neck you want to
turn on me&mdash;there now, if I was to be shot for
it, I couldn't help it&mdash;with the little place there
just inviting my lips."
</p>

<p>
"Keep your kisses for your sister, sir, or your
cousin!"
</p>

<p>
"What in the world&mdash;&mdash;  And d'ye think I
didn't know you?"
</p>

<p>
"A likely tale!"
</p>

<p>
"May I die this minute if I didn't know you
before ever you were out of the ould chair!"
</p>

<p>
"Pray, sir," with an angry titter, "how will
even your fertile wits prove that?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, didn't I see the little pink foot of you
step out, and didn't I know it before ever it
reached the ground?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord forgive you!" said Mistress Kitty
gravely.  But a dimple peeped.
</p>

<p>
He had now possessed himself of her hand,
which he was caressing with the touch of the
tentative lover, tenderer than a woman's, full
of mute cajoling inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"I hope the Lord may forgive me for setting
up and worshipping an idol.  I believe there's
something against that in the commandments,
darling, but sure, maybe, old Moses wouldn't
have been so hard on those Israelites if they'd
had the gumption to raise a pretty woman in
the midst of them, instead of an old gilt Calf."
</p>

<p>
At this word, Mistress Kitty gave a perceptible start.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," said she, "never, never speak to
me of that dreadful animal again!  Oh, Denis,"
she said, turning upon him for the first time her
full eyes, as melting and as pathetic just then as
it was in their composition to look, "I am in
sad, sad trouble, and I don't know what to do!"
</p>

<p>
Here she produced a delicate handkerchief,
and applied it to her eyelashes, which she almost
believed herself had become quite moist.
</p>

<p>
"Me jewel!" cried Mr. O'Hara, preparing
to administer the first form of consolation that
occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet," said Mistress Kitty testily.
"Get up, sir!  I have to consult you.  There,
there, sit down.  Oh, I am in earnest, and this
is truly serious."
</p>

<p>
Mr. O'Hara, though with some reluctance,
obeyed.  He drew his chair as near to the
widow's as she would permit him, and pursed
his lips into gravity.
</p>

<p>
"You know my Lord Verney," began the
fascinating widow.
</p>

<p>
"I do," interrupted the irrepressible Irishman,
"and a decent quiet lad he is, though,
devil take him, he makes so many bones
about losing a few guineas at cards that
one would think they grew on his skin!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said she.  "<i>I can't abide him!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mr. O'Hara half started from his armchair.
</p>

<p>
"Say but the word," said he, "and I'll run
him through the ribs as neat as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, be quiet," cried the lady, in much
exasperation.  "How can you talk like that
when all the world knows he is to be my
husband!"
</p>

<p>
"Your husband!"  Mr. O'Hara turned an
angry crimson to the roots of his crisp red
hair.  Then he stopped, suffocating.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't <i>want</i> to marry him, you
gaby," cried Mistress Kitty, with a charming
smile.
</p>

<p>
Her lover turned white, and leaned back
against the wing of his great chair.  The
physician had blooded him that morning by
way of mending him for his loss of the
previous night, and he felt just a little shaky
and swimming.  Mistress Kitty's eye became
ever more kindly as it marked those flattering
signs of emotion.
</p>

<p>
"The noodle," said she vindictively, "mistook
the purport of some merely civil words, and
forthwith went about bleating to all Bath that
he and I were to be wed."
</p>

<p>
"I'll soon stop his mouth for him," muttered
Mr. O'Hara, moved to less refinement of diction
than he usually affected.  "Oh, Kitty," said he,
and wiped his pale brow, "sure, it's the terrible
fright you've given me!"
</p>

<p>
Here Mistress Bellairs became suddenly and
inexplicably agitated.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand," said she, and stamped
her foot.  "Oh, how can I explain?  How
are people so stupid!  I was obliged to go to
his rooms this morning&mdash;a pure matter of
friendship, sir, on behalf of my Lady Standish.
Who would have conceived that the calf would
take it for himself and think it was for <i>his</i> sake
I interfered between him and that madman, Sir
Jasper!  'Tis very hard," cried Mistress Kitty,
"for a lone woman to escape calumny, and now
there is my Lord Verney, after braying it to the
whole of Bath, this moment writing to his
insufferable old mother.  And there is that
cockatoo aunt of his looking out her most
ancient set of garnets and strass for a
wedding-gift.  And, oh dear, oh dear; what <i>am</i> I
to do?"
</p>

<p>
She turned over the back of her chair, to
hide her face in her pocket-handkerchief.  In
a twinkling, O'Hara was again at her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Soul of my soul, pulse of my heart!" cried
he.  "Sure, don't cry, Kitty darling, I'll clear
that little fellow out of your way before you
know where you are."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir," she said, flashing round upon
him with a glance surprisingly bright, considering
her woe.  "And is that how you would save
my reputation?  No, I see there's nothing for
it," said Mistress Kitty with sudden composure,
folding up her handkerchief deliberately, and
gazing up again at the chandelier with the air of
an early martyr, "there's nothing for it but to
pay the penalty of my good-nature and go live
at Verney Hall between my virtuous Lord
Verney and that paragon of female excellence
and domestic piety, his mother."
</p>

<p>
"Now, by Saint Peter," cried O'Hara, springing
to his feet, "if I have to whip you from
under his nose at the very altar, and carry
you away myself, I'll save you from that, me
darling!"
</p>

<p>
"Say you so?" cried the lady with alacrity.
"Then, indeed, sir," she proceeded with sweetest
coyness, and pointed her dimple at him, "I'll
not deny but what I thought you could help me,
when I sought you to-night.  There was a
letter, sir," she said, "which yester morning
I received.  'Twas signed by a lock of
hair&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Kitty!" cried the enraptured and
adoring Irishman, once more extending wide
his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Softly, sir," said she, eluding him.  "Let
us to business."
</p>

<h3>
SCENE XV
</h3>

<p>
"But you must understand," said the lady, "that
you carry me off against my will."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure," said he.  "Isn't poor Denis
O'Hara to run away with you merely to save
your reputation?"
</p>

<p>
"So if I scream, sir, and give you a scratch
or two, you will bear me no malice?"
</p>

<p>
"Bear you malice, is it?" said he, stopping
to kiss each finger-tip of the hand which he
contrived somehow should never be long out
of his clasp.  "Me darling, sure, won't I love
to feel your little pearls of nails on my cheek?"
</p>

<p>
"And spare no expense upon chaise or
horses," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" cried Mr. O'Hara, while a certain
vagueness crept into his gaze.  "Me dear
love, the best that money can produce&mdash;that
money can produce," said Mr. O'Hara, and
his eye rolled under the stress and strain of
an inward calculation: ("There's my grandfather's
watch; I'm afeared the works are not
up to the gold case, but it might run to four
guineas.  And there's my jewelled snuff-box
that the Chevalier gave my father&mdash;no dash
it, that's gone!  There's my silver-hilted
sword&mdash;I could exchange it for a black one and
perhaps five guineas.  And there's my three
sets of Mechlin...")
</p>

<p>
While he cogitated, the lady smiled upon
him with gentle raillery; then she popped
her hand in her pocket and drew forth a
well-filled case.
</p>

<p>
"And did you think," said she, laying the
case on the table, "that I would have the
face to ask a <i>rich</i> lover to elope with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith," said he, pursuing now aloud his
silent addition, "there's the gold punch-bowl,
too!  I vowed as long as I'd a drop to mix
in it I'd never part with the thing; but, sure,
I little guessed what was in store for me&mdash;that
will make twenty guineas or more.  Put
up your money, Kitty; I'll not consent to be
paid for carrying you off, except," said he,
"by your sweet lips."
</p>

<p>
"Now listen, sir," she cried, lifting up her
finger, "you're a poor man."
</p>

<p>
"I am that," said he.
</p>

<p>
"And I," said she, "am a rich woman."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried he, "Kitty, my darling, and
sure that's the last thing in the world I'd
ever be thinking of now.  When I laid my
heart at your feet, my dear, 'twas for your
own sweet sake, with never a thought of the
lucre.  What's money to me," said he, snapping
his fingers, "not <i>that</i>, Kitty darling!
I despise it.  Why," he went on with his
charming infectious smile, "I never had a
gold piece in my pocket yet, but it burned
a hole in it."
</p>

<p>
She listened to him with a curious expression,
half contemptuous, half tender.  Then
she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I well believe you," said she.  "Come,
come Denis, don't be a fool.  Since the
money is there, and we know for what
purpose, what matters it between you and me
who puts it down."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he cried, with a sort of shame,
abandoning his light tone for one of very
real emotion, "you're an angel!  I'm not
worthy of you, but I'll try, Kitty, I'll try."
</p>

<p>
The lady looked slightly embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"I protest, sir; I cannot have you going
on your knees again," she cried sharply, "and
it's getting late, and the business is settled,
I think."
</p>

<p>
"Leave it to me," said he; "sure, I could
do it blindfold."
</p>

<p>
"Have the post-chay at the corner of Bond
Street and Quiet Street, 'tis the darkest in
Bath, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and the relay at Devizes, for we'll
have to push the first stage."
</p>

<p>
"And after?" said she, and looked at him
doubtingly.
</p>

<p>
"And after that&mdash;London.  And sure I
know an old boy in Covent Garden that
will marry us in a twinkle."
</p>

<p>
She nibbled her little finger.  The rapture
evoked on his countenance by this last prospect
was not reflected upon hers.
</p>

<p>
"But you forget," said she, "that I am to
be abducted against my will, and what will
people say if I marry you at the end of the
journey without more ado?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, faith," said he, without a shade of
uneasiness, "shouldn't I be a poor fellow if
I did not contrive to persuade you on the
way?  And then, what would the world say
if you did not marry me after travelling all
night with such a wild Irish devil?  Sure,"
said he, with a wink, "what else could a
poor woman do to save her reputation?"
</p>

<p>
"True," said she, musingly, and tapped
her teeth.
</p>

<p>
She tied on her mask once more and drew
up her hood, passive, in her mood of deep
reflection, to his exuberant demonstrations.
At the door she paused and looked back at
him, her eyes strangely alluring through the
black velvet peep-hole, her red lips full of
mysterious promise beneath the black lace fall.
</p>

<p>
"And I never asked," said she, in a melting
tone, "after your wound?  Does it hurt you?
Will you be able, think you, to face the
fatigues to-morrow night?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I have but one complaint, Kitty," he
cried, "and that's my mortal passion for you.
And when a man's weak with love," he said,
"sure it's then he's the strength of twenty."
</p>

<p>
"Not a step further," said she, "than this
door.  Think of the chairmen and Bath gossip.
Good-night."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XVI
</h3>

<p>
"And now, child, what's the town talk?"
said Mistress Bellairs.
</p>

<p>
The nights were chilly, and a log crackled
on the hearth.  Kitty, in the most charming
<i>déshabillé</i>, stretched a pink slippered foot airily
towards the blaze.
</p>

<p>
"La, ma'am," said Miss Lydia, as with
nervous fingers she uncoiled one powdered
roll and curl after another, "all the morning
the gossip was upon Sir Jasper's meeting with
Colonel Villiers at Hammer's Fields.  And all
the afternoon&mdash;&mdash;" she paused and poised a
brush.
</p>

<p>
"All the afternoon?  Speak, child.  You
know," said her mistress piously, "that I had
to spend my evening by the side of a dear
sick friend."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ma'am," said the maid, "the talk
is all about your own marriage with the young
Lord Verney."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, girl," cried the lady with a little
scream, "you needn't hit my head so hard
with those bristles!  What's taken you?  And
what do people think of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, ma'am," said the Abigail, wielding
her brush more tenderly, and permitting her
irritation to betray itself only in the sharp
snap of her voice, "my Lord Verney's man
says he pities anyone that will have to go
and live with her old la'ship at Verney Hall."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said Kitty, and gave herself a
congratulatory smile in the handglass.
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Burrell, ma'am, that's Lady
Maria's butler, and a wise old gentleman he
is, he says the marriage'll never take place,
ma'am, for neither his own la'ship, nor the
lady at Verney Hall, would allow of it, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, indeed?" exclaimed Mistress Bellairs,
stiffening herself, "that's all they know about
it!  Lydia, you untruthful, impertinent girl,
how dare you tell me such a story?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I beg your pardon, ma'am," said
Lydia, sniffing.  "I'm sure I up and told
Mr. Burrell that if you'd set your heart on
wedding such a poor ninny as Lord Verney&mdash;I
beg pardon, ma'am, I'm sure he'll be a very
nice young nobleman, when his beard begins
to grow&mdash;'twas not likely a deaf old cat like
his mistress could prevent him.  And I told
Lord Verney's man, ma'am&mdash;and an impudent
fellow he is&mdash;that you'd soon teach the dowager
her place, once you were mistress in Verney
Hall."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said the lady, mollified, "and
what says the rest of your Bath acquaintance?"
</p>

<p>
"Squire Juniper's head coachman says his
master'll drink himself to death, as sure as
eggs, on the day that sees you another's,
ma'am.  He's been taking on terrible with
Madeira ever since he's heard the news.  And
the Marquis' running footman, he says 'that
Lady Flyte'll have it all her own way with
his lordship now, and mores the pity, for,'
says he, 'her la'ship's not fit to hold a candle
to the widow'; excuse the language, he knows
no better, his strength is mostly in his legs,
ma'am.  And Mr. Stafford's jockey says, ma'am,
that in his opinion you're a lady as will never
be drove again in double harness."
</p>

<p>
"Did he say so, indeed!" said Mistress
Bellairs, reflectively.  "Well, my good creature,
and what say you?"
</p>

<p>
"La!" said the maid, and the brush trembled
over her mistress's curls, "I say, ma'am, that
if you was to make such a sacrifice, you so
young, and lovely, and so much admired, I
humbly hopes you might pick out someone
livelier than my Lord Verney."
</p>

<p>
"Now, whom," said Mistress Bellairs, in a
tone of good-humoured banter, "would you
choose, I wonder?  What would you say to
the Marquis, Lydia?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ma'am!  His lordship is a real
nobleman&mdash;as the prize-fighters all say&mdash;and a
better judge in the cockpit, Mr. Bantam, the
trainer, says, never breathed, drunk or sober;
and no doubt when he's sober, ma'am, he'd
make as good a husband as most."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, girl, enough of him.  What
of Mr. Stafford, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Stafford, ma'am, that's a comely
gentleman; not one bit of padding under his
stockings, and an eye 'twould wheedle the
very heart out of one's bosom!  And, no doubt,
if you ever thought of him, ma'am, you'd see
that he paid off the little French milliner
handsome.  He's a very constant gentleman,"
said Miss Lydia, with a suspicion of spite.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh," cried the lady, and pushed her chair
away from the fire, "what nonsense you do
talk!  And pray what thinks your wisdom of
Mr. O'Hara?"
</p>

<p>
"Lud! ma'am," cried the guileless maiden,
"that's the gentleman as was found behind
Lady Standish's curtains."
</p>

<p>
"If you were not a perfect idiot," cried the
widow, "you would not repeat <i>that</i> absurd
tale, much less expect me to believe it.
Mr. O'Hara has never even spoken to Lady
Standish."
</p>

<p>
The unusual warmth in her mistress's tone
struck the girl's sharp wits.  She glanced
quickly at the lady's reflection in the glass,
and made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Mistress Bellairs, "what else
have you against him?  Is he not handsome,
child?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, ma'am, handsome enough for such
as like red hair."
</p>

<p>
"And merry, and good company?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ma'am, none better, as half the rogues
in Bath know."
</p>

<p>
"Tush&mdash;you mean he is good-natured, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"He never said 'no' in his life, ma'am, I
do believe, to man or woman."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then?" cried her mistress testily.
</p>

<p>
"And generous," gabbled Lydia, charmed
by the cloud she beheld gathering on the brow
reflected in the glass, "open-handed, ma'am.
Mr. Mahoney&mdash;that queer peculiar servant of
his&mdash;many a time he's told me, ma'am, that
his only way to keep his wages for himself,
and seldom he sees the sight of them, is to
spend them at once, for his good master is
that free-handed, ma'am, he'd give the coat off
his servant's back."
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite aware," said the lady loftily,
"that Mr. O'Hara's estates in Ireland are
slightly embarrassed."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what they call it, ma'am," cried
Lydia shrilly.  "It's not a ha'porth of rent the
old lord's seen these twelve months.  Last
year they lived on the pictures.  And now it's
the plate, I'm told.  But, indeed, ma'am, as
Mr. Mahoney says, what does it matter to a
gay gentleman like Mr. O'Hara?  Sure, he's
the sort, as he says to me only yesterday, that
would come to a fortune on Monday and be
sending to the pawnshop on Saturday."
</p>

<p>
"You may go to bed, Lydia," cried Mistress
Bellairs, rising hastily; "you've half deafened
me with your chatter."
</p>

<p>
Left alone the little lady sat down by the
fire in a melancholy mood.
</p>

<p>
"The sort that would come to a fortune on
Monday, and be sending to the pawnshop on
Saturday....  I'm afraid it's true.  Yet, I
believe, he loves me, poor Denis!  I vow,"
she said to herself, "'tis the only one of them
all that I could <i>endure</i>.  Yes, I could endure
Denis, vastly well ... for a while at least.
And now," said she, "what's to be done!
Oh, I'd be loath to baulk him of the pleasure
of running away with me! 'tis the only decent
way indeed of breaking with my Lord Verney.
And it certainly struck me that Master Stafford
was mighty cool upon the matter.  I've been
too quiet of late, and that odious Bab Flyte
thinks she can have everything her own way....
But, I'll be rescued," she said, "at Devizes&mdash;I
shall have to be rescued at Devizes.  My
poor dear; he may be happy at least for an
hour or two ... as far as Devizes!"
</p>

<p>
Her brow cleared; the dimples began to play.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," she smiled more broadly,
"if we cannot prod his Calfship into a night
trot.  'Twill do his education a vastness of
service....  But the poor creature," she
reflected further, "is scarce to be depended on.
Who knows whether his mother would approve
of his breathing the night air....  I must,"
Mistress Kitty's pretty forehead became once
more corrugated under the stress of profound
thought&mdash;"I must," she murmured, "have
another string to my bow, or my sweet
O'Hara will marry me after all.  Dear fellow,
how happy we should be from Monday ... till
Saturday!  Who?  Who, shall it be? ... My
Lord Marquis might take the <i>rôle</i> in
earnest and spoil my pretty fellow's beauty.
Squire Juniper?  He would sure be drunk.
And Master Stafford?  Oh, <i>he</i> may stay with
the French milliner for me!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the lady's perplexed countenance
became illumined.  "Sir Jasper?" she said.
"Sir Jasper&mdash;the very man!  The good
Julia&mdash;I owe it to her to bring matters to an
<i>éclaircissement</i>.  And, Sir Jasper&mdash;oh, he richly
deserves a midnight jolt, for 'tis owing to his
monstrous jealousy that I am put to all this
trouble.  'Twill be a fine thing indeed," thought
Mistress Bellairs with a burst of self-satisfied
benevolence, "if I can demonstrate to Sir
Jasper, once for all, the folly into which this
evil passion may lead a man."
</p>

<h3>
SCENE XVII
</h3>

<p>
"If you please, my lady," said Mistress
Megrim, "I should like to quit your ladyship's
service."
</p>

<p>
"How?" cried Lady Standish, waking with
a start out of the heavy sleep of trouble, and
propping herself upon her elbow, to gaze in
blinking astonishment at the irate pink
countenance of her woman.  Lady Standish looked
very fair and young, poor little wife, with her
half-powdered curls of hair escaping in
disorder from the laces of her nightcap, and her
soft blue eyes as full of uncomprehending
grief as a frightened baby's.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Megrim gazed upon her coldly and
her old-maid's heart hardened within her.
</p>

<p>
"No, your ladyship," said she, with a
virtuous sniff, "I shouldn't feel as I was doing
my duty to her ladyship, your mother, nor to
my humble self, were I to remain an hour
longer than I could help, the Handmaid of
Sin."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," said Lady Standish, letting
herself fall back on her pillows with a
weary moan, "I do wish you'd hold your
tongue, woman, and allow me to rest!
Pull the curtain again; oh, how my head
aches!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my lady," ejaculated Megrim,
all at once in a towering passion.  "Since
you're that hardened, my lady, that a sign
from Heaven couldn't melt your heart&mdash;I
allude to that man of God, his lordship the
Bishop (oh, what a holy gentleman that is!);
and, my lady, me and Mistress Tremlet saw
him out of the pantry window as he shook
the dust of this House of Iniquity from his
shoes; if that vessel of righteousness could
not prevail with your ladyship, what hopes
have I that you'll hear the voice of the Lord
through me?"
</p>

<p>
"Megrim, hold your tongue," said her mistress
in unwontedly angered tones, "pull the
curtains and go away!"
</p>

<p>
With a hand that trembled with fury Mistress
Megrim fell upon the curtains and rattled
them along their pole.  Then she groped her
way to Lady Standish's bedside and stood
for some seconds peering malevolently at her
through the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't believe it, my lady," she hissed
in a ghastly whisper, "although indeed I might
have known that such a gentleman as Sir
Jasper would never have taken on like that
if he hadn't had grounds.  But you've
mistaken your woman, when you think you can
make an improper go-between of me!  Oh,"
cried she, with a rigid shudder, "I feel myself
defiled as with pitch, that these fingers should
actually have touched sich a letter!"
</p>

<p>
"For goodness sake," moaned the lady from
her pillows, "what are you talking about now?"
</p>

<p>
"My lady," said Megrim sepulchrally, "when
that minx with her face muffled up in a hood,
came and had the brazen boldness to ask for
me this morning, saying she had some lace
of your ladyship's from the mender's, and that
it was most particular and must be given into
my hands alone, my mind misgave me.  'Twas
like an angel's warning.  The more so as
there isn't a scrap of your ladyship's lace as
has been to the mender's since we came here."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, Megrim, how you do ramble on!
I can't make head or tail of your stupid
story."  Even a dove will peck.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, do I, my lady!  Can't you indeed?
Perhaps your ladyship will understand better
when I tell her, that that same bold thing had
no lace at all&mdash;but a letter.  'Give it to your
mistress,' says she, 'in secret, and for your life
don't let Sir Jasper see it.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, give it to me," said Lady Standish,
"and hold your tongue, and go and pack your
trunks as soon as you like."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, my lady," cried the incorruptible
Megrim, with an acid laugh, "I hope I know
my Christian duty better.  I brought the letter
to my master, according to the Voice of
Conscience.  And now," she concluded, with a
shrill titter, "I'll go and pack my trunks."
</p>

<p>
Yet she paused, expecting to enjoy Lady
Standish's outburst of terror and distress.
There was no sign from the bed, however,
not even a little gasp.  And so Mistress
Megrim was fain to depart to her virtuous
trunks without even that parting solace.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, with the pillow of her spotless
conscience to rest upon, and deadened to fresh
disturbances by the despairing reflection that
nothing for the present could make matters
much worse between her and her husband,
Lady Standish, without attempting to solve
the fresh problem, determinedly closed her
weary eyes upon the troubles of the world and
drifted into slumber again.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
"I shall catch them red-handed," said Sir Jasper.
</p>

<p>
This time all doubt was over: in his hand
lay the proof, crisp and fluttering.  He read
it again and again, with a kind of ghastly joy.
Unaddressed, unsealed, save by a foolish green
wafer with a cupid on it, the document which
Mistress Megrim's rigid sense of duty had
delivered to him instead of to his guilty wife,
was indited in the self-same dashing hand as
marked the crumpled rag that even now
burned him through his breast-pocket like a
fly-blister.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"I never got a wink of sleep, dreaming of you, dearest
dear, so soon to be my own at last!  The chay shall be
drawn by horses such as Phoebus himself, my darling,
would have envied.  And, so you fail me not, we shall
soon be dashing through the night&mdash;a world of nothing
but happiness and love before us.  I could find it in my
heart to bless the poor foolish individual who shall be
nameless, since, had it not been for my lovely one's
weariness of him, she might never have turned to the arms of
her own devoted,
</p>

<p class="letter">
RED CURL!
</p>

<p class="letter">
P.S.&mdash;I'll have as good a team as there is in England
(barring the one that shall bring us there), waiting for us
at the Black Bear, Devizes.  We ought to arrive before
midnight, and there shall be a dainty trifle of supper for
your Beautyship&mdash;while the nags are changed.  Ah, my
dear, <i>what</i> rapture!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Indescribable were the various expressions
that crossed Sir Jasper's countenance upon the
perusal and re-perusal of this artless missive.
Now he gnashed his teeth; now snorts of
withering scorn were blown down the channels
of his fine aquiline nose; now smiles of the
most deadly description curled and parted
luridly his full lips.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" said Sir Jasper, "and perhaps the
poor foolish individual may give you cause for
something less than blessings, Master Carrots!
And I think, madam, your beautyship may find
at Devizes something harder to digest than that
trifle of supper!  Till then, patience!"
</p>

<p>
He folded the letter, placed it beside its
fellow, and once more, with a sort of bellow, he
cried, "<i>Patience!</i>"
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lydia?" said Bellairs.  She had
but just finished her chocolate, and looked
like a rose among her pillows.
</p>

<p>
"Well, madam," said Lydia, still panting
from her hurried quest, "'tis safe delivered.
I gave it into Mistress Megrim's own hands,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And can you reckon," said the lady, smiling
at the amusing thought, "upon her bringing it
straight to Sir Jasper?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, lud, ma'am, yes.  I told the sour, ugly
old cat, that if her master caught sight of it,
Lady Standish would be ruined.  You should
have seen how she grabbed at it, ma'am!"
</p>

<p>
"Lydia," said her mistress, looking at her
admiringly, "I question whether I'd have
risked it myself; you're a bold girl!  But
there, if anything fail, you know that
rose-coloured pelisse remains hanging in my
closet."
</p>

<p>
"Never fear, ma'am," said Lydia, smiling
quietly to herself, as she pulled her mistress's
long pink silk stocking over her hand, and
turned it knowingly from side to side, looking
for invisible damage, "the pelisse is as good as
mine already."
</p>

<p>
"But, think you, was Sir Jasper at home?"
said Mistress Bellairs, after a few moments'
reflection.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of that," said Lydia triumphantly,
peeling off the stocking.  "I thought it best to
go in by the mews, ma'am, and I heard that Sir
Jasper had not left the house since that little&mdash;that
little affair with the Bishop, you know,
ma'am.  But all the night, and all the morning,
he kept William and Joseph (those are the
grooms, ma'am) going backwards and forwards
with challenges to the Bishop's lodgings."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Kitty, and kicked her little toes
under the silk counterpane with exquisite
enjoyment, "and what does the Bishop answer, I
wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Sends back the letter every time unopened,
ma'am, with a fresh text written on the back of
it.  The texts it is, William says, that drive Sir
Jasper mad."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! oh! oh!" cried Mistress Kitty faintly,
rolling about her pillows.  "Child, you'll be the
death of me! ... Well, then, to business.
You know what you are to do to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"No sooner are you gone to the Assembly
Rooms this evening, ma'am, than I take a letter
from you for Lady Standish, and this time
deliver it myself to her own hand, and, if
needs be, persuade her to follow your advice,
ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"Right, girl; thou shalt have the gold
locket with the Turkey stones&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, ma'am.  Well, then, I'm to
scurry as fast as I can to the corner of Bond
Street and Quiet Street, and watch you
being carried off by the gentleman.  And
then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be sure you wait till the chaise has well
started."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am, of course!  When you're safely
on the London Road, I'll go and give the alarm
at the Assembly Rooms."
</p>

<p>
"Remember, you ask first for Lord Verney."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ay, ma'am.  'My mistress is carried off,
is carried off!  Help, help, my lord!' I'll
say.  Oh, ma'am, I'll screech it well out, trust
me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget," said her mistress, whose
mood became every moment merrier, "don't
forget to say that you heard the ravisher
mention London, by Devizes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ma'am," said Lydia, "I thought of
saying that he first flung you swooning upon
the cushions of the chay; then, stepping in
himself, cried out to the coachman, with an
horrible oath, 'If you're not in Devizes before
twelve, I'll flay you with your own whip, and
then hang you with it to the shaft!'"
</p>

<p>
"Aha, ha, Lydia," laughed her mistress.
"I see I must give you a gold chain to hang
that locket upon.  But pray, child," she added
warningly, "be careful not to overdo it."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XVIII
</h3>

<p>
The livelong day Lady Standish had not
beheld the light of her lord's countenance.
</p>

<p>
Upon their last meeting, his behaviour to
the Bishop having roused in her gentle bosom
a feeling as nearly akin to resentment as it
was capable of harbouring, she would not be
(she had resolved) the one to seek him first.
She had, therefore, passed the day in her
own apartment in writing to her mother, and
in practising her last song to the harp&mdash;a
piece of audacity and independence which she
expected would have goaded Sir Jasper into
an instant interview with herself.
</p>

<p>
When the dusk rose, however, and the
candles were brought in by the round-eyed
handmaid, whose ministrations replaced those
of Megrim (the latter was still packing, and
seemed like to take some weeks in the process),
and the said round-eyed damsel immediately
began to inform her mistress that Sir Jasper
had set forth in his coach, Lady Standish's
small flame of courage began to flicker woefully.
</p>

<p>
"Alone?" she asked in white dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Please, my lady, Mr. Bowles was driving,
and there was Mr. Thomas behind, my lady."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw, girl!  Did Sir Jasper take any
luggage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, my lady; there was his yellow
bag, Mr. Toombs says, and a small wooden
case."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" cried Lady Standish, with
increasing alarm.  "And whither went they?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, my lady, Mr. Toombs says they
took the London Road."
</p>

<p>
Fain would the round-eyed maid have lingered
and told more, but Lady Standish waved
her hand faintly, and so dismissed her.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, Lydia, brisk with importance,
and sparkling with conscious power, found the
much-tried soul sunk in a sort of apathetic
weariness of misery.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Bellairs' love, my lady, and will
you read this letter at once?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish took the letter from the
black-mittened hand.
</p>

<p>
"Please my lady, 'tis of the utmost
importance," said Lydia, "and I was to wait and see
if I could not be of use to you."
</p>

<p>
Something magnetic in the girl's lively tone
gave impetus to Lady Standish's suspended
energies.  She broke the seal.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"My sweet child," wrote Mistress Kitty.  "If you want to
know what has become of your husband, you will instantly
take a chaise and start off for the Black Bear at Devizes.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Your true friend,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"K. B.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Postscriptum.&mdash;Do not go alone.  Get some old hag
(if possible Lady Maria Prideaux) to accompany you.  You
will find her in the Assembly Rooms.  She's as curious
as our first mother&mdash;you can easily persuade her.  <i>This
is good advice!</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I am much too ill," cried Lady Standish,
upon a moan.  "Tell your mistress," said she,
looking vaguely in Lydia's direction, "that
indeed 'tis quite impossible I should do as she
suggests."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my lady," said Lydia cheerfully.
"I'm sure I shouldn't trouble myself if I was
you.  Gentlemen <i>must</i> have their diversions, I
always say.  If ladies would but shut their eyes
a little more, 'twould be for the peace of all
parties.  Indeed, my lady, though my mistress
would be angry to hear me say so, I'd go to
bed, for you look sorely tired, and Sir Jasper'll
be glad enough to come home bye-and-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Wretched girl," cried Julia, and her eyes
flashed, "what dost thou mean?"
</p>

<p>
"La, now!" said Lydia, all innocence, "how
my tongue do run away with me, to be sure!
Why, my lady, what can a poor servant-maid
like me know of the goings on of gentles?  'Tis
but a few words of gossip here and there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, merciful heavens, <i>what</i> gossip mean you?"
</p>

<p>
"My lady, have a sip of <i>volatile</i>, do!  Oh,
my mistress would be like to kill me if she
knew what I've been saying!  'Poor Julia,'
she cried when she got the news.  'Poor
Julia, my poor confiding Julia!  Oh, the villain,
the monster!'"
</p>

<p>
"Good God, and whom did she refer to?"
</p>

<p>
"Lud, madam, how can I tell?  '<i>It shall not
be!</i>' cries my mistress, and down she sits and
writes off to you, as if for bare life."
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish, rising from her seat, rushed
to the light, and with starting eyes and bristling
hair began to read afresh her fond Kitty's
missive.
</p>

<p>
"La, my lady," cried the guileless Lydia,
"you're all of a shake!  I'd never be that
upset about Sir Jasper.  Why, if your la'ship'll
allow me to say so, all Bath knows how jealous
he is of your la'ship; and, certain that shows a
husband's affection."
</p>

<p>
"True," cried Julia, "that's true, girl!"
</p>

<p>
"And as for those who say, my lady, that
some men are so artful that they put on a deal
of jealousy to cover a deal of fickleness, I'd
despise myself if I was to pay heed to such
mean suspiciousness."
</p>

<p>
"My cloak!" cried Lady Standish.  "Megrim,
Susan!"  She flew to the hall.  "My cloak,
let a post-chaise be ordered immediately!"
</p>

<p>
"If I may make so bold, my lady," said
Lydia, retiring gracefully upon the conviction
of a well-accomplished errand, "don't forget to
take Lady Maria with you, if you can.  The
gentlemen have such a way of turning tables
on us poor women&mdash;at least," said the damsel
demurely, "so I've heard said.  And 'tis a long
lonely road, my lady!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XIX
</h3>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs took her departure early.
</p>

<p>
Attired in unusually sober colours, floating
in an atmosphere of chastened, matronly
dignity, she had shown herself this evening,
thought Lord Verney, quite worthy to be his
mother's daughter-in-law.
</p>

<p>
"Monstrous dull," Lady Flyte called the
pretty widow's demeanour.
</p>

<p>
Beyond a <i>gavotte</i> with Lord Verney, she had
not danced, but sat for half-an-hour on the chair
next to Lady Maria, who presented her with
the vision of a shoulder-blade which had seen
better days, and an impenetrability of hearing
which baffled even Kitty's undaunted energy.
</p>

<p>
When Verney had tucked her up in her
sedan she insisted upon the young peer allowing
her to proceed home unescorted.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said she, "I pray you, nay, I order
you.  People talk so in this giddy place, and
have you not your aged aunt to wait upon?  I
am sure," said Mistress Kitty piously, "that
your dear mother would wish it thus."
</p>

<p>
He submitted.  He had no doubt that his
mother would indeed entirely concur with such
sentiments, and blessed his Kitty for her sweet
reasonableness.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, then," she said, thrusting her
pretty face out of the window with a very
tender and gentle smile.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," he replied, with his young,
gracefully-awkward bow.
</p>

<p>
She fully expected to hear his footstep pursue
the chairman, for she had not been able to
refrain from throwing her utmost fascination
into that parting look.  But nothing broke the
silence of the parade save the measured
slouching tramp of the bearers.
</p>

<p>
At once disappointed and relieved, she threw
herself back in her seat.
</p>

<p>
"What, not a spark left," said she, "of the
fine flame 'twas so easy to kindle this morning!
'Tis the very type of the odious British husband.
Let him be but sure of you, and the creature
struts as confident of his mastery as the cock
among his hens.  Lord!" she shuddered, "what
an escape I have had!  We women are apt to
fancy that very young men are like very young
peas, the greener, the tenderer, the better;
whereas," said the lady, with a sigh, "they are
but like young wine, crude where we look for
strength, all head and no body, and vastly poor
upon the palate."
</p>

<p>
She sighed again, and closed her eyes,
waiting for the moment of the impending
catastrophe with a delicate composure.
</p>

<p>
In truth, Mr. O'Hara conducted the performance
with so much <i>brio</i> as to convince Mistress
Bellairs that he must have had previous
experience of the kind.
</p>

<p>
At the dark appointed corner the two muffled
individuals who, each selecting his own astonished
chairman, enlaced him with overwhelming
brotherly affection, seemed such thorough-paced
ruffians in the dim light, that Mistress Kitty
found it quite natural to scream&mdash;and even had
some difficulty in keeping her distressful note
down to the pitch of necessary discretion.
</p>

<p>
And her heart fluttered with a sensation of
fear, convincing enough to produce quite a
delightful illusion, when she found herself
bodily lifted out of her nest and rapidly carried
through the darkness in an irresistibly close and
strong embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh, oh!" cried the lady, in a modulated
sequence of little shrieks.
</p>

<p>
"Merciful heavens!" she thought to herself,
with a great thump of the heart, astonished at
her ravisher's silence, "what if it should be
someone else after all?"
</p>

<p>
But the next instant the rich brogue of a
tender whisper in her ear dispelled all doubt.
</p>

<p>
"You've forgotten the scratches, my darling,"
said O'Hara, as he laid her preciously upon the
cushions of the chaise.
</p>

<p>
Here Mr. Mahoney and his comrade&mdash;which
latter bore a curious resemblance in build and
gait to one of the sporting Marquis's own
celebrated gladiators&mdash;came running up to take
their seats.  In leaped O'Hara&mdash;the coachman
lifted his whip, and the team that Phoebus might
have envied started up the length of Milsom
Street in style.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
The chairmen, drawing their breath with
some difficulty after their spell of strangulation,
stared in amazement at the clattering shadow
as it retreated up the steep street; and then
back, and in fresh amazement, at the yellow
guinea which had been pressed, and now
glinted, in the palm of their hands.
</p>

<p>
Presently a simultaneous smile overspread
their honest countenances.
</p>

<p>
"A queer go," said the first, easing and
readjusting his necklace.  "Lud, the little
madam did squeak!"
</p>

<p>
"I'd let them all squeak at the same price,"
said the other, pocketing his coin, and resuming
his place in rear of the sedan.  "But come,
Bill, we must go report this 'orrible crime.
Rabbit me!&mdash;what's that?"
</p>

<p>
A blood-curdling wail had risen out of the
night, from his very elbow it seemed.  It
circled in frightful cadence, and died away in
ghost-like fashion.
</p>

<p>
"'T&mdash;'tis but a sick cat, I hope," stammered
the first chairman, and dived for the
chair-poles in marked hurry.
</p>

<p>
"O&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o," moaned the voice, "oh, my
mistress!"  There was a flutter, a patter, and:
"Merciful heavens, you wretches!" cried
Mistress Bellairs's devoted woman, emerging like
a gust of wind from the blackest shadow of
Bond Street and falling upon the nearest
chairman with a well-aimed flap of her
shawl, followed up by a couple of scratches.
"Wretches, monsters, you've let my mistress
be carried away!  Oh heavens, my unhappy
mistress!" cried Lydia, and rent the night
with her cries.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty's chair had no sooner left
the precincts of the Assembly Rooms when my
Lady Standish's post-chaise came clattering
round the corner.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney, who was just about to go in
again, arrested by curiosity, turned to wonder
at a visitor who arrived in so unwonted a
conveyance.  Recognising Lady Standish he
was somewhat abashed and somewhat disconcerted,
but felt he could do no less than
advance through the crowd of foot and chair
men and offer his hand.
</p>

<p>
"O, pray, Lord Verney," said she in a
strenuous whisper, "conduct me to your aunt,
for I have great need of her help and
counsel.  Take me to her at once," said the
poor lady, in ever-increasing agitation.
</p>

<p>
They passed through the elegant throng,
she unconscious alike of recognition, comment,
or titter, he feeling to his boy's marrow, the
sensation created by her travelling gear and
distraught appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Would I were back at Verney Hall,"
thought he, and found that this wish had been
long gathering in his heart.
</p>

<p>
No need of an ear-trumpet for Lady Maria
now.  The dowager recovered her powers of
hearing with almost miraculous celerity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lady Maria!" said Lady Standish,
holding out both her hands.  And incontinently
she burst into tears.  "Oh, Lady Maria,
Sir Jasper has left me, I am in sad trouble!
I'm told he has gone to Devizes.  I must
follow him.  You are my mother's oldest
friend; will you give me the support of your
company and protection?"
</p>

<p>
There was quite a buzz in the interested
circle.  Lady Maria nodded round, charmed
with the situation; bristling with delighted
curiosity, she was more like Mistress Kitty's
cockatoo than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Poor young thing, poor young thing," she
said, patting Lady Standish's hand; "your
mother's oldest friend, quite so&mdash;quite right
and proper to come to me.  And so Sir
Jasper's left you; so Sir Jasper's gone; and
with whom, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Maria fondly believed that she spoke
these last words in a gentle aside; but never
had her sepulchral bass resounded more
sonorously.  Lady Standish's faint cry of shocked
disclaimer was, however, completely drowned
in the fresh rumour, lacerated by shrill feminine
shrieks, which now arose in the vestibule
of the Assembly Rooms and rapidly advanced.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord Verney!  My mistress!  Where
is my Lord Verney?" wailed the distraught
Lydia, who thoroughly enjoyed her <i>rôle</i>.
</p>

<p>
A hundred voices took up the cry; the
astounding news passed from group to group:
"The pretty widow has been carried
off!"  "Mistress Bellairs has been abducted!"  And
then, in counter clamour and antiphone: "and
my Lady Standish is looking for Sir Jasper!"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, before Lord Verney, dumb and
suffocating under a variety of emotions, Lydia
wringing her hands and with the most thrilling
notes of tragic woe (as nearly copied from
Mistress Susanna Cibber as she could remember),
narrated her tristful tale.
</p>

<p>
"He flung my unhappy mistress, swooning
and shrieking, into the chaise.  And 'Drive
like the devil,' cries he in a voice of thunder
to the coachman.  'I'll flay you with your
own whip and hang you to your own shaft,'
says he, 'if you're not in Devizes before
midnight!'"
</p>

<p>
"Devizes!" cried Lady Standish with a
scream.  Hanging on Lydia's utterance, every
word of which confirmed the awful suspicion
that had entered her heart, she now could
no longer doubt the real extent of her
misfortune.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord Verney, save my mistress!"  Lydia's
pipe dominated the universal chorus
with piercing iteration.
</p>

<p>
And now Lady Maria's bass struck in again.
</p>

<p>
"What did I say?" cried she triumphantly.
"Nevvy, you'd better go to bed! you're well
out of her.  Julia, my dear, don't faint, we
can catch them at Devizes yet.  Someone
tell that wench to stop that screeching!  Julia,
come!  You've got the chay, I understand.
Fortunately, my house is near; we shall just
call for Burrell and make him ride behind
with his blunderbuss.  Child, if you faint I
wash my hands of the whole affair.  We'll
nip them, I tell you, if you'll only brisk up."
</p>

<p>
"I won't faint," said Lady Standish setting
her teeth.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney suddenly awoke to the fact
that he had been grievously injured, and that
he was in a towering passion.  Spluttering,
he demanded vengeance of gods and men.
Post-chaise, ho, and pistols, forthwith!  "My
sword!" cried he, feeling for the blade which,
however, according to the regulations enforced
by the immortal Master of the Bath Ceremonies,
was absent from its natural post on
his noble hip in this polite assembly.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me," cried Captain Spicer,
clapping his patron on the shoulder in a burst
of excitement.  "I'll stand to you, of course,
lad!  You'll want a witness.  Gad!" exclaimed
the amiable Captain, "we'll have Sir Jasper's
liver on the spit before crow of cock!"
</p>

<h3>
SCENE XX
</h3>

<p>
The side-rays of the chaise-lamps played on
the widow's soft, saucy face, threw beguiling
shadows under her eyes, and fleeting dimples
round those lips that seemed perpetually to
invite kisses.
</p>

<p>
Cosily nestling in the corner of the carriage,
her head in its black silk hood tilted back
against the cushions, in the flickering
uncertain gleam, there was something almost
babyish in her whole appearance; something
babyish, too, in her attitude of perfect
confidence and enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Denis O'Hara, with one arm extended
above her head, his hand resting open on
the panel, the other hand still clasping the
handle of the door, gazed upon the woman
who had placed herself so completely in his
power, and felt smitten to the heart of him
with a tenderness that was well-nigh pain.
Hitherto his glib tongue had never faltered
with a woman that his lips were not ready
to fill the pause with a suitable caress.  But
not so to-day.
</p>

<p>
"What's come to me at all?" said he to
himself, as, frightened by the very strength
of his own passion, he could find no word at
once ardent and respectful enough in which
to speak it.  And, indeed, "What had come
to him?" was what Mistress Kitty was
thinking about the same time.  "And what
may his arm be doing over my head?" she
wondered.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful you are!" babbled the
Irishman at last.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bellairs sat up with an angry start.
It was as if she had been stung.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" cried she, thrusting her little
forefingers into her ears.  "Mr. O'Hara, if
you say that again, I shall jump out of the
chay."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed; she looked capable of
fulfilling her threat upon the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Me darling heart," said he, and had
perforce to lay his hands upon her to keep her
still.  "Sure what else can I say to you, with
my eyes upon your angel face?"
</p>

<p>
Apparently the lady's ears were not so
completely stopped but that such words could
penetrate.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis monstrous," said she in hot indignation,
"that I should go to all this trouble
to escape from the bleating of that everlasting
refrain, and have it buzzed at me," she waxed
incoherent under the sense of her injuries,
"thus at the very outset!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear love," said he, humbly, capturing
the angry, gesticulating hand, "sure me heart's
so full that it's just choking me."
</p>

<p>
She felt him tremble beside her as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
Now the trembling lover was not of those
that entered into Mistress Kitty's scheme of
existence.  She had, perhaps, reckoned, when
planning her escapade, upon being made to
tremble a little herself.  She had certainly
reckoned upon a journey this evening that
should be among the most memorable in the
annals of her impressions.  O'Hara bashful!
O'Hara tongue-tied!  O'Hara with cold fingers
that hardly dared to touch hers!  O'Hara, the
gay rattler, with constrained lips!
</p>

<p>
This was an O'Hara whose existence she
had not dreamed of, and for whose acquaintance,
to say the truth, she had small relish.
</p>

<p>
"What has come to you?" she cried aloud,
with another burst of petulance.
</p>

<p>
"Faith," said he, "and I hardly know myself,
Kitty darling.  Oh, Kitty," said he, "'tis
vastly well to laugh at love, and play at love;
but when love comes in earnest it takes a
man as it were by the throat, and it's no joke
then."
</p>

<p>
"So I see," said she, with some dryness.
</p>

<p>
O'Hara clenched his hand and drew a
laboured breath.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Straining, slipping now and again, breaking
into spurts of trot, to fall into enforced walking
pace once more, the gallant team had dragged
the chaise to the summit of the great rise at
a speed quite unprecedented, yet comparatively
slow.
</p>

<p>
Now the way lay down-hill.  The coachman
waved his whip.  Bounding along the fair
road the wheels hummed; the night-wind
blowing in through the half-opened window,
set Mistress Kitty's laces flapping on her
bosom, and a stray curl of Mr. O'Hara's
dancing on his pale forehead.
</p>

<p>
The exhilaration of the rapid flight, the
crack of the whip, the mad rhythm of the
hoofs, the witchery of the night hour, the risks
of the situation, the very madness of the whole
enterprise, all combined to set the widow's
gay blood delightfully astir, mounting to her
light brain like sparkling wine.
</p>

<p>
What! were all the accessories of the play
to be so perfect, and was the chief character
to prove such a lamentable failure in his part?
What! was she, Kitty Bellairs, to be carried
off by the most notorious rake in Bath, only
to find him as awkward, as dumb, as
embarrassed with the incomparable situation as
the veriest greenhorn?  "It shall not, and it
cannot be," said she to herself.  And
thereupon she changed her tactics.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said she aloud, with the cooing
note of her most melting mood, "I protest
one would think, sir, that you were afraid of me."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, Kitty," said he, simply; "and so I am."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fie!" she laughed.  "And how have
I alarmed you?  Think of me," said she, and
leaned her face towards him with a smile of
archest wit, "not as a stranger, but as a
sisther, as a dear, dear cousin."
</p>

<p>
His eye flamed back at her.  Her merry
mood was as incongruous to his sudden,
storm-serious growth of passion as the gay lilt of a
tambourine might be to a solemn chant.
</p>

<p>
"I think of you," he said, and there was a
deep thrill in his voice, "as my wife that is
to be."
</p>

<p>
And so saying he fell upon his knees in
the narrow space, and tenderly kissed a fold
of her lace, as one, from the knowledge of
his own fire, afraid of a nearer touch.
</p>

<p>
The word "wife" had never a pleasing
sound in the lovely widow's ears.  From
neither the past nor the future did it evoke
for her an attractive picture.
</p>

<p>
Coming from those lips, by which it was
the very last name she desired to hear herself
called, it aroused in her as pretty a fit of
fury as ever she had indulged in.
</p>

<p>
"Now, indeed, is the murder out!" she
cried.  "Oh, you men are all alike.  As
lovers&mdash;all fire, capsicums Indian suns!
Bottles of Sillery always bursting!  Torrents
not to be stemmed....  But, lo you! let the
lover once fancy himself the husband, let the
vision of the coveted mistress but merge into
the prospect of the secured wife....  Merciful
heavens, what a change!  For fire we have
ice; for the red, biting capsicum, the green,
cool cucumber; for joyous, foaming Sillery,
the smallest ale; small ale&mdash;nay, toast and
water!" cried Mistress Kitty, lashing herself
to finer frenzy.  "And if the mere sense of
your security thus transforms the lover in you,
what a pleasing prospect, indeed, lies before
the wedded wife!  No, thank you, sir," said
the lady, and pushed the petrified O'Hara
with an angry foot, "I have had one wintry,
toast-and-water husband, and that shall be
enough for my lifetime.  Thank God, it is
not too late yet!" she fumed.  "I am not
yet, sir, Mistress O'Hara."
</p>

<p>
And in the very midst of her indignation:
"This will," she thought, "simplify the parting
at Devizes."  But no whit was her wrath
thereby abated, that the fool should have
spoiled her pretty ride.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, after the angry music of her
voice had ceased to ring, there was a breathless
silence, broken only by the straining progress
of horses and chaise up the sides of another
hill.  Then O'Hara broke forth into a sort
of roar of wounded tenderness, passion, and
ire.  Flinging himself back upon the seat, he
seized her wrist in a grip, fierce, yet still gentle
under its fierceness.
</p>

<p>
"How dare ye!" cried the man, "how dare
ye doubt my love!  Sure the flames of hell are
cold compared to me this minute.  May my
tongue wither in my mouth, may it be cut out
of my jaws and never speak a word of sense
again, may I be struck dead at your feet, Kitty,
for the rest of my life, if it's not gospel truth!
Listen to my heart," he cried, with yet greater
vehemence, pressing her captive hand against
his breast, "isn't it <i>Kitty, Kitty, Kitty</i>
... that it's saying?  Sure it's nothing but a bell,
and your name is the clapper in it! ... And
you to be railing at me because it's so much I
have to say that never a word can I bring out!
Oh," pursued Mr. O'Hara, waxing louder and
more voluble still, "sure what could I say, with
my heart in my mouth stopping the way?  Look
at it, you cruel woman; isn't it all yours, and
aren't you sticking pins into it for sheer
devilment, this minute?  God forgive me, that I
should say such a thing of an angel!  Look at it,
now, Kitty!  Is that the heart of a cucumber? ... If
you had said a love-apple itself....
Och, indeed, it's the real cool cucumber I am,
and it's toast and water that's running through
my veins like fire! ... Laugh, madam, laugh,
it's a grand joke entirely!  Make a pin-cushion
of the cucumber!  See, now, is that small ale
that bursts from the wounds?  Upon my soul,"
he cried, arrived at the height of his tempest,
"I have a mind to show you the colour
of it!"
</p>

<p>
He reached violently towards the back seat
for his sword as he spoke, and Mistress Bellairs,
suddenly arrested in her delighted paroxysm,
was sufficiently convinced of the strength of his
feelings to stop him with clinging hands and
clamouring little notes of terror:
</p>

<p>
"O'Hara! madman!&mdash;for God's sake, Denis!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried he.  "It's not hot enough I
was for ye.  It's the cold husband you're
afraid of.  Ah, Kitty, you've stirred the
sleeping dog, you mustn't complain now if you
can't put out the fire!"
</p>

<p>
So saying, he turned and clasped her in an
embrace that left her scarcely breath to scream,
had she so wished, and had indeed the kisses
which he rained upon her lips allowed her
space in which to place a protest.
</p>

<p>
Her light soul, her easy shallow nature,
was carried as it were off its feet in the
whirlwind of a passion the mere existence of which,
with all her experience, she had never even
guessed.  To say the truth, so much as she
had deemed him vastly too cold, so now she
found him vastly too hot.  She was a woman
of niceties, an epicure in life and love, and
nothing met with her favour but the delicate
happy mean.  This was a revelation, with a
warning.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Hara," she gasped, at length released,
fluttering like a ruffled dove, all in
anger and fear, "such treatment!  For a
gentleman, sir, you strangely forget
yourself."  She laid her hand on the window strap.
"Not a word, sir, or I will instantly give the
order to turn back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried the unhappy lover, and tore at
his hair with desperate fingers, filling the
ambient air with flakes of powder which shone
silvery in the moonlight.  "You drove me
to it.  Ah, don't be frightened of me, my
darling; that hurts me the worst of all!  I'm
quiet now, Kitty."
</p>

<p>
His labouring breath hissed between his
words, and his satin coat creaked under each
quivering muscle.
</p>

<p>
"I'm as quiet as a lamb," said he; "sure a
baby might put its head in my jaws&mdash;the
devil's gone out of me, Kitty."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear it, sir," said she,
unappeased.  She sat, swelling with ruffled
plumes, looking out of the window and biting
her lips.
</p>

<p>
"A moon, too," she thought, and the tears
almost started to her eyes, for the vexation
of the wasted opportunity and the complete
failure of a scene so excellently staged.  "How
wise, oh, how wise I was, to have secured
my exit at Devizes!"
</p>

<p>
"I frightened her," thought O'Hara; and
in the manly heart of him he lamented his
innate masculine brutality and formed the most
delicate chivalrous plans for the right cherishing
in the future of the dear lady who had
confided herself to him.
</p>

<h3>
SCENE XXI
</h3>

<p>
In the white moonlight Sir Jasper Standish
paced up and down the cobble-stoned yard
with as monotonous a restlessness as if he
had been hired this night to act the living
sign at the Bear Inn, Devizes.
</p>

<p>
Each time he passed the low open window
of the inn parlour, in which sat Mr. Stafford
by the dim yellow light of two long-tongued
tallow candles, the baronet would pause a
moment to exchange from without a few
dismal words with his friend.  The latter,
puffing at a long clay pipe, endeavoured in
the intervals to while away the heavy minutes
in the perusal of some tome out of mine host's
library&mdash;a unique collection and celebrated on
the Bath Road.
</p>

<p>
"Tom Stafford," said Sir Jasper, for the
twentieth time, "how goes the hour?"
</p>

<p>
"Damned slowly, friend," said Stafford,
consulting with a yawn the most exact of three
watches at his fob.  "To be precise, 'tis two
minutes and one third since I told you that
it wanted a quarter of midnight."
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper fell once more to his ursine
perambulation, and Stafford, yawning again,
flicked over a page.  He had not reached
the bottom of it, however, before Sir Jasper's
form returned between him and the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"What," said the injured husband, "what
if they should have taken another road?"
</p>

<p>
"Then," cried Stafford, closing his book
with a snap between both his palms, tossing
it on to the table and stretching himself
desperately, "I shall only have to fight you
myself for this most insufferably dull evening
that you have made me spend, when I was
due at more than one rendezvous, and had
promised pretty Bellairs the first minuet."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be pistols," said Sir Jasper,
following his own thoughts with a sort of gloomy
lust, "pistols, Tom.  For either he or I shall
breathe our last to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Pistols with all my heart," said Stafford,
stopping his pipe with his little finger.  "Only
do, like a good fellow, make up your mind&mdash;just
for the sake of variety.  I think the last
time we considered the matter, we had
decided for this"&mdash;describing a neat thrust at
Sir Jasper's waistcoat through the window
with the long stem of his churchwarden.
"There's more blood about it, Jasper," he
suggested critically.
</p>

<p>
"True," murmured the other, again all
indecision.  "But pistols at five paces&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;yes, there's a charm about five
paces, I admit," returned the second with
some weariness, dropping back again into his
chair.  "And we can reload, you know."
</p>

<p>
"If I fall," said Sir Jasper, with the emotion
which generally overtakes a man who
contemplates a tragic contingency to himself, "be
gentle with her.  She has sinned, but she
was very dear to me."
</p>

<p>
"She'll make a deuced elegant widow," said
Stafford, musingly, after a little pause, during
which he had conjured up Lady Standish's
especial points with the judgment of a true
connoisseur.
</p>

<p>
"You must conduct her back to her home,"
gulped Sir Jasper, a minute later, slowly
thrusting in his head again.  "Alack, would
that I had never fetched her thence....
Had you but seen her, when I wooed and won
her, Tom!  A country flower, all innocence, a
wild rose....  And now, deceitful, double-faced!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the way of the wild rose," said Stafford,
philosophically.  "Let you but transplant
it from the native hedgerow, and before
next season it grows double."
</p>

<p>
Here the speaker, who was always ready
with a generous appreciation of his own
conceits, threw his head back and laughed
consumedly, while Sir Jasper uttered some
sounds between a growl and a groan.
</p>

<p>
The volatile second in waiting wiped his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Go to, man," cried he, turning with sudden
irascibility upon his friend, "for pity's sake
take that lugubrious countenance of thine out
of my sight.  What the devil I ever saw in
thee, Jasper, to make a friend of, passes my
comprehension: for, of all things, I love a
fellow with a spark of wit.  And thou, lad,
lackest the saving grace of humour so wofully,
that, in truth, I fear&mdash;well&mdash;thou art in
a parlous state: I fear damnation waits thee,
for 'tis incurable.  What! in God's name
cannot a man lose a throw in the game of
happiness and yet laugh?  Cannot a husbandman
detect a poacher on his land and yet laugh
as he sets the gin?  Why," cried Mr. Stafford,
warming to his thesis, and clambering lightly
out of the window to seat himself on the outer
sill, "strike me ugly!  shall not a gentleman be
ever ready to meet his fate with a smile?  I
vow I've never yet seen Death's head grin at
me, but I've given him the grin back&mdash;split me!"
</p>

<p>
"Hark&mdash;hark!" cried Sir Jasper, pricking
his strained ear, "d'ye hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!" said Mr. Stafford, "only the wind
in the tree."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," cried Sir Jasper; "hush man, listen!"
</p>

<p>
An unmistakable rumbling grew upon the
still night air&mdash;a confused medley of sounds
which gradually unravelled themselves upon
their listening ears.  It was the rhythmical
striking of many hoofs, the roll of wheels, the
crack of a merciless whip.
</p>

<p>
"Faith and faith," cried Stafford, pleasantly
exhilarated, "I believe you're right, Jasper;
here they come!"
</p>

<p>
The moonlight swam blood-red before Sir
Jasper's flaming eye.  "Pistols or swords?"
questioned he again of himself, and grasped
his hilt as the nearest relief, pending the
decisive moment.
</p>

<p>
Out slouched a couple of sleepy ostlers, as
Master Lawrence, mine host, rang the stable
bell.
</p>

<p>
Betty, the maid, threw a couple of logs on
the fire, while the dame in the bar, waking
from her snooze, demanded the kettle, selected
some lemons, and ordered candlesticks and dips
with reckless prodigality.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty, peering out of the carriage
window, her shoulder still turned upon the
unhappy and unforgiven swain, hailed the
twinkling lights of the <i>Bear Inn</i> with lively eyes.
</p>

<p>
While the chaise described an irreproachable
curve round the yard, her quick glance had
embraced every element of the scene.  Sir
Jasper's bulky figure, with folded arms, was
leaning against the post of the inn door, awaiting
her approach&mdash;retribution personified&mdash;capriciously
illumined by the orange rays of
the landlord's lantern.  Out in the moonlight,
shining in his pearl gray satin and powdered
head, all silver from crest to shoe-buckle, like
the prince of fairy lore, sat Stafford on his
window-ledge, as gallant a picture to a woman's
eye, the widow had time to think, as one could
wish to see on such a night.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she thought, "how we are going to
enjoy ourselves at last!"
</p>

<p>
And being too true an artist to consider her
mere personal convenience upon a question of
effect, she resolved to defer the crisis until the
ripe moment, no matter at what cost.  Accordingly,
even as O'Hara cried out, in tones of
surprise and disgust: "Thunder and turf! my
darling, if there isn't now that blethering ox,
Sir Jasper!"  Mistress Kitty instantly covered
her face with her lace and swooned away on
the Irishman's breast.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper charged the coach door.  "Blethering
ox!" he bellowed.  "I'll teach you, sir,
what I am!  I'll teach that woman&mdash;I'll,
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Stafford sprang lightly to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake," said he, "think of our
names as gentlemen; let it be swords or pistols,
Jasper, or swords and pistols, if you like, but
not fistycuffs and collaring.  Be quiet, Jasper!
And you, sir," said he to O'Hara, as sternly as
he could for the tripping of his laughter, "having
done your best to add that to a gentleman's
head which shall make his hats sit awry for the
remainder of his days, do you think it generous
to give his condition so precise a name?"
</p>

<p>
"O hush," cried O'Hara, in too deep distress
to pay attention either to abuse or banter, "give
me room, gentlemen, for God's sake.  Don't
you see the lady has fainted?"
</p>

<p>
With infinite precaution and tenderness he
emerged from the chay with his burden, elbowing
from his path on one side the curious and
officious landlord, on the other the struggling
husband.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what have I done at all!" cried the
distracted lover, as the inertness of the weight
in his arms began to fill him with apprehension
for his dear.  "Sure, alanna, there's nothing to
be afraid of!  Sure, am I not here?  Och, me
darling, if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But here Sir Jasper escaped from his friend's
control.  "I'll not stand it," cried he.  "'Tis
more than flesh and blood can endure.  Give
her up to me, sir.  How dare you hold her?"  He
fell upon O'Hara in the rear and seized him,
throttling, round the neck.
</p>

<p>
"I'll dare you in a minute, ye mad divil!"
yelled O'Hara, in a fury no whit less violent
than that of his assailant.  Thus cried he, then
choked.
</p>

<p>
In the scuffle they had reached the parlour.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jasper, Jasper, in the name of decency!"
protested Stafford, vainly endeavouring to pluck
the baronet from the Irishman's back.  "And
you, Denis lad, I entreat of you, cease to provoke
him.  Zooks, my boy, remember he has some
prior claim&mdash;what shall I say? some little vested
interest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'll stuff him with his own red hair!"
asseverated Sir Jasper, foaming at the mouth
as, under a savage push from O'Hara's elbow
he fell back, staggering, into Stafford's power.
</p>

<p>
"Prior claims&mdash;vested interest is it!  Some
of you will have to swallow those words before
I'll be got to swallow anything here," swore
Denis O'Hara, almost gaily, in the exaltation
of his Celtic rage.  "Sure, 'tis mad, I know ye
are, lepping mad, Sir Jasper, but ought you not
to be ashamed of yourself before the lady?
She's quivering with the fright....  Lie here,
my angel," said he, vibrating from the loudest
note of defiance to the tenderest cooing.  "Lie
here; there's not a ha'porth to frighten ye, were
there fifty such twopenny old crazy weathercocks
crowing at you!"
</p>

<p>
So saying, he deposited his burthen tenderly
in the leather-winged arm-chair by the
fire-place, and turned with a buoyant step
towards Sir Jasper.
</p>

<p>
"Come out," said he, "come out, sir.
Sure, leave him alone, Tom, 'tis the only
way to quiet him at all.  Sure, after our
little game the other night, wasn't he that
dove-like, poor fellow, a child might have
milked him?"
</p>

<p>
The quivering form in the chair here
emitted a scale of hysterical little notes that
seemed wrung from her by the most
irrepressible emotion.  And:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh," exclaimed Mr. Stafford, unable,
in the midst of his laughter, to retain any
further grip upon his friend.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," once more began the solicitous
O'Hara, turning his head round towards
the arm-chair, but:
</p>

<p>
"Judas!" hissed Sir Jasper, and furiously
interposed his bulk between the Irishman and
his intention.
</p>

<p>
"Faith," cried Stafford, "can't you cover
that head of yours, somehow, O'Hara?  I
vow the very sight of it is still the red rag
to the bull....  The bull, aha!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" broke in, this time
uncontrolled, the merriment from the chair.
</p>

<p>
The three men were struck into silence
and immobility.
</p>

<p>
Then, on tip toe, Mr. Stafford approached
and peeped round the wing of the arm-chair.
He looked, and seemed blasted with astonishment;
looked again and made the rafters ring
with his sonorous laugh, till the apprehensive
landlord in the passage and the trembling
dame in the bar were comforted and reassured
by the genial sound.
</p>

<p>
The high feminine trill of Mistress Kitty's
musical mirth rang in sweetly with his.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kitty Bellairs, Kitty Bellairs!" gasped
Mr. Stafford, shook his finger at her, felt
blindly for a support, and rolled up against
Sir Jasper.
</p>

<p>
The baronet straightway fell into an opportunely
adjacent chair and there remained&mdash;his
legs extended with compass stiffness, his
eyes starting with truly bovine bewilderment&mdash;staring
at the rosy visage, the plump little
figure, that now emerged from the inglenook.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, oh dear!" faintly murmured
Stafford.  And with a fresh breath he was off
again.  "Aha ha ha! for an ox, my Jasper,
thou hast started on a lovely wild goose
chase&mdash;as friend O'Hara might say."  While:
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" rippled the lady.  "I
protest, 'tis the drollest scene.  Oh, Sir Jasper,
Sir Jasper, see what jealousy may bring a
man to!"
</p>

<p>
"Musha, it's neither head nor tail I can
make of the game," said O'Hara, "but sure
it's like an angel choir to hear you laugh
again, me darling."
</p>

<p>
The guileless gentleman approached his
mistress as he spoke, and prepared to encircle
her waist.  But with a sudden sharpness she
whisked herself from his touch.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, sir," she said, "remember how we
stand to each other!  If I laugh 'tis with
relief to know myself safe."
</p>

<p>
"Safe?" he echoed with sudden awful misgiving.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said she, and spoke more tartly
for the remorseful smiting of her own heart,
as she marked the change in his face.  "You
would seem to forget, sir, that you have
carried me off by violence&mdash;treacherously
seized me with your hired ruffians."  Her
voice grew ever shriller, as certain rumours,
which her expectant ears had already caught
approaching, now grew quite unmistakable
without, and hasty steps resounded in the
passage.  "Oh, Mr. O'Hara, you have cruelly
used me!" cried the lady.  "Oh, Sir Jasper,
oh, Mr. Stafford, from what a fate has your
most unexpected presence here to-night thus
opportunely saved me!"
</p>

<p>
At this point she looked up and gave a
scream of most intense astonishment: for there,
in the doorway, stood my Lord Verney; and,
over his shoulder, peered the white face of
Captain Spicer, all puckered up with curiosity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XXII
</h3>

<p>
O'Hare drew himself up.  He had grown all
at once exceedingly still.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stafford, gradually recovering from his
paroxysms, had begun to bestow some
intelligent interest upon the scene.  There was
a mist of doubt in his eyes as he gazed from
the victimised, but very lively, lady to her
crestfallen "violent abductor," and thence to
the gloomy countenance of the new-comer on
the threshold.  There seemed to be, it struck
him, a prodigious deliberation in Mistress
Kitty's cry and start of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"What is my pretty Bellairs up to now?
Well, poor Irish Denis, with all his wits, is
no match for her anyhow, and, faith, she
knows it," thought he.  Aloud he said, with
great placidity: "Fie, fie, this is shocking to
hear!" and sat, the good-humoured Chorus
to the Comedy, on the edge of the table,
waiting for the development of the next scene.
Sir Jasper, wiping a beaded brow and still
staring, as if by the sheer fixing of his
bloodshot eye he could turn these disappointing
puppets into the proper objects of his vengeance,
was quite unable to follow any current
but the muddy whirl of his own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Lord Verney alone it was, therefore, who
rose at all to Mistress Kitty's situation.
</p>

<p>
"Are <i>you</i> the scoundrel, then," said he,
marching upon O'Hara, "who dared to lay
hands upon an unprotected lady in the very
streets of Bath?"
</p>

<p>
"Monstrous!" remarked Captain Spicer
behind him.  Then jogging his patron's elbow,
"'Twas well spoke, Verney, man.  At him
again, there's blood in this."
</p>

<p>
Mr. O'Hara looked steadily at Lord Verney,
glancing contemptuously at Captain Spicer,
and then gazed with long, full searching at the
beguiling widow.
</p>

<p>
She thought to scent danger to herself in the
air; and, womanlike, she seized unscrupulously
upon the sharpest weapon in her armoury.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," she said, with an angry, scornful
laugh, "Mr. O'Hara will now deny that he
and his servants attacked my chairmen in the
dark, threw me, screaming with terror, into his
carriage, and that his intention was avowedly to
wed me by force in London to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
All eyes were fixed on the Irishman, and
silence waited upon his reply.  He had grown
so pale that his red head seemed to flame by
contrast.  He made a low bow.
</p>

<p>
"No, Kitty," said he, in a very gentle voice,
"I deny nothing."  Then sweeping the company
with a haughty glance.  "This lady," said
he, "has spoken truth; as for me, I am ready to
meet the consequences of my conduct."
</p>

<p>
His eye finally rested once more on Lord
Verney.  The latter grew white and then
scarlet; while Spicer whispered and again
jogged.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," blustered the youth, and wished
that he had the curious digestion of his
contemporaries, that his stomach did not so squeamishly
rebel at the prospect of a dose of steel, "of
course, sir, you must be aware&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It shall be swords," interrupted the
irrepressible Spicer; "and gad, sir, what my noble
friend will have left of your body I will myself
make mince of this night!  Aye, sir," said the
Captain, beginning to squint as was his wont
under excitement, and slapping his bony chest;
"I will fight you myself, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Fight <i>you</i>!" exclaimed O'Hara, suddenly
stung into magnificent contempt.  "Fight you,
sir?" he ran a withering eye over the grasshopper
anatomy of the toady as he spoke, "you,
sir, you, the writer of that dirty note this morning,
bidding me apologise&mdash;apologise!" cried Denis,
with his most luscious brogue, "to the man, Sir
Jasper there, for having insulted you on the
subject of your miserable mealy head&mdash;fight
you, sir?  Sure, rather than fight you," said
Mr. O'Hara, searching for the most emphatic
asseveration conceivable, "I'd never fight again
for the rest of my life!  But I'll tell you what
I'll do for you: next time you thrust that ugly
face of yours within the reach of me arm Oi'll
pull your nose till it's as long as your tongue,
and as slender as your courage, damme!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, gad! what a low scoundrel," murmured
Captain Spicer, withdrawing quickly several
paces, and with an intensified cast in his eye;
"'tis positive unfit for a gentleman to speak to
him!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, my lord?" said O'Hara, resuming his
easy dignity.
</p>

<p>
But that her comedy should drift into tragedy
was none of Mistress Kitty's intentions.  Briskly
stepping between the laboriously pugnacious
Verney and the poor Irishman, whose eye (for
all his present composure) shone with the lust
of the fray, she thus addressed them collectively
and in turn:
</p>

<p>
"Shame, shame, gentlemen, I protest!  Is it
not enough that a poor woman's heart should be
set a-fluttering by over-much love, must it now
go pit-a-pat again for over-much hate?  My
Lord Verney, think of your mother.  Think of
her, of whose declining years you are the sole
prop and joy; recall to mind those principles of
high morality, of noble Christian duty, which
that paragon of women so sedulously inculcated
in you!"  Her voice quivered on the faintest
note of mockery.  "Oh, what would that worthy
lady's feelings be, were you to be brought home
to her&mdash;a corse!  What, ah what indeed! would
<i>your</i> feelings be if, by some accident," here she
shot involuntarily what was almost the suspicion
of a wink in the direction of O'Hara, "you had
to answer for the life of a fellow-creature before
to-morrow's dawn?  Why, you could never open
your Bible again without feeling in your bosom
the throbbing heart of a Cain!"  She stopped to
draw breath.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stafford, one delighted grin, slid the
whole length of the table on which he sat with
dangling legs, to get a fuller view of the saucy
face: "Incomparable Bellairs," he murmured to
himself with keen appreciation, And: "So, ho,
my noble friend," thought he, as he shot a glance
at the solemn Verney, "now do I know what
has closed to you for ever the gates of Paradise."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Mr. O'Hara," resumed the lady,
turning her eye, full of indefinable and
entrancing subtleties upon the honest gentleman,
"would you have me forgive you this night's
work?  Do not, then, do not force this
impetuous young man to an unnecessary quarrel.
Allow him to withdraw his challenge.  Do that
in <i>atonement</i>, sir," said she, with much severity
of accent; but her eye said sweetly enough,
"Do that for me" and gave further promise of
unutterable reward.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said O'Hara, glancing away as if
the sight of her beauty were now more pain
than pleasure to him, "'tis for my Lord Verney
to speak; I am entirely at his orders.  I
understand," and here, for all his chivalrousness, he
could not refrain him from a point of satire, "I
understand, ma'am, that you have given him the
right to espouse your quarrels."
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly," said the crimson Verney,
who had been monstrously uneasy during his
lady's sermon, not only because every word of
it hit some tender point of his abnormally
developed conscience, but also because of an
indefinable sensation that he was being held
up to ridicule, "most certainly, sir, it is as
Mistress Bellairs's future husband that I find
it incumbent&mdash;that I find myself forced,
reluctantly&mdash;no, I mean&mdash;&mdash;" here he floundered
and looked round for Spicer, who, however,
was ostentatiously turning his back upon the
proceedings and gazing at the moon.  "In
fact," resumed the poor youth, falling back
on his own unguided wits, "I have no
alternative but to demand satisfaction for an
attempt on the honour of the future Lady
Verney."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" cried Mistress Kitty, with a
shrill indignant little scream.  "Oh fie, my lord,
who would have deemed you so bloodthirsty?
Before heaven," she cried piously, glancing at
the raftered ceiling, "before heaven, it would
be the death of me, were there to be quarrelling,
strife, contention for me&mdash;for <i>me</i>!  Who am I,"
she said with the most angelic humility, "that
two such gallant gentlemen should stake their
lives for me?  Rather," said she, "will I give
you back your word, my lord.  Indeed," this
with a noble air of sacrifice, "I feel Providence
has but too clearly shown me my duty.  Hush,
hush, Verney, bethink yourself!  How could I
ever face your mother (were you indeed to
survive the encounter) with the knowledge
that I had exposed you to danger; that for
me you had loaded your soul with blood-guiltiness!"
</p>

<p>
She shuddered and looked delicious.
</p>

<p>
"Child," said she meltingly, as Lord Verney
faintly protested, "it must be so.  I have felt it
more than once; you are too young."  There
was a conviction in her voice that gave no hope
of reprieve, and Lord Verney, who had already
found out that Mistress Bellairs was too dangerous
a delight to pursue with comfort, accepted
his sentence with a Christian resignation that
did justice to his mother's training.
</p>

<p>
"All, all must now be over between us,"
said Kitty pathetically, "save a gentle
friendship!  Your hand, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
She reached for his clumsy paw with her
determined little fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Hara," said she, turning round.
"<i>I forgive you</i>.  Your hand also, sir."
</p>

<p>
If the clasp she extended to Verney was
purely official, that with which she now seized
O Hara's cold right hand was eloquent enough
with quick and secret pressure.  But, for the
first time in his life, perhaps, O'Hara was
slow in returning a woman's token.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands," ordered Mistress Bellairs
decisively, and joined the belligerents' palms.
</p>

<p>
Here Stafford sprang jovially to the
assistance of the pretty peacemaker.
</p>

<p>
"Right, right," cried he.  "Shake hands
on it like good fellows.  Fie! who could keep
up a feud under those beaming eyes?&mdash;Never
be downcast, Verney, lad!  What did I tell
thee, only yesterday, in the Pump Room,
about thy halo?&mdash;Denis, my boy, I've always
loved thee, but now I'll love thee more than
ever, if only thou wilt mix us a bowl of
punch in right good Irish fashion, so that in
it we may drown all enmity and drink good
friendship&mdash;and above all toast the divine
Kitty Bellairs!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurroosh," cried O'Hara, and with a
valiant gulp determined to swallow his own
bitter disappointment and flood in a tide of
warm gaiety the cold ache in his heart.  "By
all means," cried he, wrung Verney's hand
with feverish cordiality, and gave one last
sadly-longing look at Kitty and his lovely
delusive dream.
</p>

<p>
Then spinning round upon himself he demanded
loudly of the willing landlord, lemons
and "the craythur&mdash;a couple of bottles, my
friend&mdash;a bowl of sugar and a trifle of
wather&mdash;the smaller the kittle the better it
boils."  And: "Wake up, man," cried he,
slapping Sir Jasper on the back so that the
powder flew from that baronet's queue.  "Sure
we're all happy, now."
</p>

<p>
"Where's my wife, sir?" said the gloomy
husband, springing to his feet fiercely.  "I've
been made a fool of between you, but all this
does not tell me where my wife is!  Stafford,
man, I see it now: this has been a blind."  He
struck his forehead.  "Ha, yes I have
it now, it was a false scent&mdash;the villain, the
fox is off with her on another road, with his
tongue in his cheek, grinning to think of me
sitting and waiting for them at Devizes!&mdash;Tom,
the chaise, the horses!  There's not a
moment to be lost!"
</p>

<p>
"Devil a horse or chay for me, sir," cried
his friend.  And nodding at Kitty: "I know
when I'm in good company," he pursued, "if
you don't.&mdash;Sit down, man, there's punch
brewing.  Your vengeance will keep hot
enough, ha, ha, but the punch won't."
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to God," cried O'Hara, staring
at Sir Jasper as if he were a natural curiosity,
"I've known many a madman, but I never
knew one mad enough yet to run away from
a punch-bowl!"
</p>

<p>
With lace ruffles neatly turned back from his
deft hands, O'Hara began to peel the lemons.
</p>

<p>
"Do you," now said Captain Spicer with
an ingratiating chirp.  "Do you really care
for <i>quite</i> so much peel in the bowl ... ahem?"
</p>

<p>
The speaker stopped suddenly and seemed
to wither quite away under a sudden look from
the punch-brewer (who had made a movement
as though to put his knife and lemons down
and employ his fingers differently) and the next
instant found him whispering in Stafford's ear:
</p>

<p>
"You're a man of the world, I know,
friend Stafford," said he.  "No doubt you
will laugh at my over-nice sense of delicacy,
but just now, in his ravings, poor O'Hara
made a kind of threat, I believe, about pulling
my nose.  What would <i>you</i> advise me to do
in the matter?  Look over it, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," cried the spark, with a glance
of the most airy contempt.  "Look over it,
<i>as straight as you can</i>.  Look over it, by all
means, but as you value the symmetry of
that ornament to your countenance, Captain
Spicer&mdash;if I were you I should keep it
well-buttered."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
With an art of which he alone was master,
Captain Spicer hereupon vanished from the
company, without being missed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
SCENE XXIII
</h3>

<p>
"'Tis an orgy!" exclaimed Lady Maria.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jasper!" sobbed Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be interesting to know," further
trumpeted Lady Maria, "which of these
gentlemen is supposed to have run away
with the widow Bellairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kitty!" sobbed Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Sir Jasper, laying down
his reeking glass and hardly believing his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty (seated between O'Hara and
Stafford at the end of the table, while Lord
Verney and Sir Jasper faced each other),
continued, unmoved, to sip her fragrant brew
and cocked her wicked eye at the newcomers,
enjoying the situation prodigiously.  She laid
an arresting hand upon the cuffs of her neighbours,
who, all polite amazement, were about
to spring to their feet.  "Keep still," said she,
"keep still and let Sir Jasper and his lady
first have their little explanation undisturbed.
Never intermeddle between husband and wife,"
she added demurely: "it has always been one
of my guiding axioms!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sir Jasper Standish, these are pretty
goings on!" cried Lady Maria, "for a three
months' husband.... (Hold up, my poor
dear Julia!) Profligate!" snorted the old
lady, boring the baronet through with one
gimlet eye.  "Dissolute wretch! highwayman!"
</p>

<p>
"I demand," fluted Lady Standish's plaintive
treble (in her gentle obstinate heart she
had come to the fixed resolution of never
allowing Sir Jasper out of her sight again),
"I demand to be taken back to my mother,
and to have an immediate separation."
</p>

<p>
"Running away with women out of the
streets of Bath!&mdash;A lady," (sniff) "supposed
to be engaged to my nevvy!  Poor deluded
boy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And my dearest friend!&mdash;oh, Jasper!
<i>How could you</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper broke in upon his wife's treble
with the anguished roar of the goaded: "The
devil take me," cried he, "if I don't think
the whole world's going mad!  <i>I</i> elope with
the widow Bellairs, Lady Maria, ma'am?  <i>I</i>
treacherous, my Lady?  Ha!"  He positively
capered with fury and wounded feeling and
general distraction, as he drew the incriminating
documents from his breast, and flourished
them, one in each hand, under the very nose
of his accusers.  "What of <i>Red Curl</i>, madam?
What of the man who kissed the dimple,
madam?  What of your lover, madam!"
</p>

<p>
In his confusion he hurled the last two
demands straight in Lady Maria's face, who,
with all the indignation of outraged virtue,
exclaimed in her deepest note:
</p>

<p>
"Vile slanderer, I deny it!"
</p>

<p>
Here Mistress Bellairs deemed the moment
ripe for her delicate interference.
</p>

<p>
"My lovely Standish," she cried, "you
look sadly.  Indeed I fear you will swoon
if you do not sit.  Pray Mr. Stafford, conduct
my Lady Standish to the arm-chair and
make her sip a glass of cordial from the
bowl yonder."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kitty!" cried Lady Standish, and
devoured the widow's face with eager eyes
to see whether friend or enemy was heralded
there.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," whispered Kitty, "nothing
could be going better.  Sit down, I tell you,
and I promise you that in ten minutes you
will have Sir Jasper on his knees."
</p>

<p>
Then running up to Sir Jasper and speaking
with the most childlike and deliberate
candour:
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Sir Jasper," said she, "and what
might you be prating of letters and red curls?
Strange now," she looked round the company
with dewy, guileless eyes, "<i>I</i> lost a letter
only a day or two ago at your house&mdash;a,"
she dropped her lids with a most entrancing
little simper, "a rather private letter.  I
believe I must have lost it in dear Julia's
parlour, near the sofa, for I remember I
pulled out my handkerchief&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" said Sir Jasper, hoarsely,
and glared at her, all doubt, and crushed the
letters in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Could you&mdash;could <i>you</i> have <i>found</i> it, Sir
Jasper, I wonder?  Mercy on me!  And
then this morning ... 'tis the strangest
thing ... I get another letter, another
rather private letter, and after despatching a
few notes to my friends, for the life of me,
I could not find the letter any more!  And
I vow I wanted it, for I had scarce glanced
at it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mistress Bellairs!" cried Sir Jasper.
"Tell me," cried he panting, "what did these
letters contain?"
</p>

<p>
"La!" said she, "what a question to put
to a lady!"
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, madam!" said he, and
in truth he looked piteous.
</p>

<p>
"Then, step apart," said she, "and for
dear Julia's sake I will confide in you, as a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
She led him to the moonlit window, while
all followed them with curious eyes&mdash;except
Verney, who surreptitiously drank his punch,
and slid away from the table, with the fear
of his aunt in his heart.  And now Mistress
Kitty hung her head, looked exceedingly
bashful and exceedingly coy.  She took up
a corner of her dainty flowered gown and
plaited it in her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Was there," she asked, "was there anything
of the description of a&mdash;of a trifling lock
of hair, in the first letter&mdash;'twas somewhat of
an auburn hue?"
</p>

<p>
"Confusion!" exclaimed the baronet, thrust
the fateful letters into her hand, and turning
on his heel, stamped his foot, muttering
furiously: "Curse the fool that wrote them,
and the feather-head that dropped them!"
</p>

<p>
"And what of the fool that picked them
up and read them?" whispered Mistress
Kitty's voice in his ears, sharp as a slender
stiletto.
</p>

<p>
She looked him up and down with a fine
disdainful mockery.
</p>

<p>
"Why will you men write?" said she meaningly.
"Letters are dangerous things!"
</p>

<p>
He stood convicted, without a word.
</p>

<p>
"La! what a face!" she cried aloud now.
"I protest you quite frighten me.  And how is
it you are not overjoyed, Sir Jasper?  Here is
your Julia proved whiter than the driven snow
and more injured than Griselidis, and you not
at her feet!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?" said Sir Jasper, half
strangled by contending emotions.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there, in that arm-chair in the inglenook."
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty smoothed her restored treasures
quite tenderly, folded them neatly and
slipped them into the little brocade bag that
hung at her waist.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Lady Standish," said Mr. Stafford,
"a glass of punch will do you no harm."
</p>

<p>
"Punch?" echoed Lady Maria&mdash;then turning
fiercely on her nephew: "What, my Lord!"
said she, "would your mother say?  Why
you are positively reeking with the dissolute
fumes!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lady Maria," interposed the
urbane Stafford, "a mere cordial, a grateful
fragrance to heighten the heart after fatigue
and emotions, a sovereign thing, madam,
against the night air&mdash;the warmest antidote!
A sip of it, I assure you, would vastly restore you."
</p>

<p>
"I," she said, "I, drink with the profligate
and the wanton!  The deceiving husband and
the treacherous friend!" She gave the fiercer
refusal for that she felt so strongly in her old
bones the charm of his description.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, pooh! my dear ladies, if that is all,"
said Mr. Stafford, "then, by Heaven, let the
glass circulate at once!  Indeed, your La'ship,"
turning to Lady Standish, "so far from our
good Jasper having anything to say to Mistress
Bellairs's presence here to-night, let me assure
you that he and I set out alone at an early hour
this evening, with no other object but to be of
service to your ladyship&mdash;whom your anxious
husband had been led to believe was likely to
come this way ... somewhat&mdash;ah&mdash;unsuitably
protected, as he thought."
</p>

<p>
Then he bent down and whispered into Lady
Standish's pretty ear (which she willingly enough
lent to such consoling assurances): "As for your
friend," he went on, "our delightful if volatile
Bellairs&mdash;she came here with a vastly different
person to Sir Jasper: poor O'Hara yonder&mdash;who's
drinking all the punch!  She will tell you
herself how it happened....  But, gracious
stars, my <i>dear</i> Lady Maria, have you not yet
been given a glass of the&mdash;of Mr. O'Hara's
restorative!"
</p>

<p>
"Allow me," cried Kitty, who, having just
settled Sir Jasper's business for him, had
now freedom to place her energies elsewhere.
"Dearest Lady Maria&mdash;how sweet of you to
join us in our little reconciliation feast!"  She
took a brimming glass from O'Hara's hands
and held it, with a winning smile, for Lady
Maria's acceptance.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," responded the matron, scowled,
drew her voluminous skirts together and became
impenetrably deaf.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," cried the widow in her topmost notes,
"Madam, how I should have revered such a
relative as yourself!  Next to the joy of calling
my Lord Verney's mother, <i>my</i> mother, would
have been that of calling his aunt, <i>my</i> aunt!
But the dream is over.  Lord Verney and I can
never be more to each other than we are now."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" and the Dowager recovered her
hearing.  "What's that, what's that, nevvy?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis, alas, true," said Lord Verney, with
great demureness.  "Mistress Bellairs has given
me back my word."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, dear Lady Maria," trilled the
widow.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" ejaculated the old lady;
then, as if unconsciously, groped for the glass
in Mistress Kitty's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, sit down all!" cried Mistress
Bellairs.  Stafford echoed with a jovial shout.
There was a call for a fresh bowl.  O'Hara's
eyes began to dance, his tongue to resume its
glibness.  And Lady Maria was surprised to
find how long her tumbler took to empty, but,
curiously, never failed to be looking the other
way when Mistress Bellairs with tenderest
solicitude plied the silver ladle in her direction.
</p>

<p>
"I hope," said the ancient lady, now wreathed
in smiles, "I hope that Mr. O'Hara's cordial
is not really stronger than Madeira wine&mdash;which
my physician, that charming Sir George, says
is all I ought to drink."
</p>

<p>
"Madeira?" cried Mr. O'Hara, "Madeira
wine is a very fair drink ... it is a fine stirring
dhrink.  But 'tis apt, I'm afraid, to heat the
blood overmuch.  Now Claret," he went on,
pursuing the thesis, "Claret's the wine for
gentlemen&mdash;only for the divil of a way it has
of lying cold upon the stomach ... after four
or five bottles....  Do I hear you say:
'Port,' over there, Tom, me boy?  I'll not deny
but that Port has qualities.  It's strong, it's
mellow&mdash;but it's heavy.  It sends a fellow to
sleep, and that's a tirrible bad mark against it;
for 'tis near as bad for a man to sleep when
he has a bottle going, as when he has a lady
coming.  Then there's Champagne for you:
there's exhilaration in Champagne, 'tis the real
tipple for a gentleman when he's alone&mdash;in a
<i>tête-à-tête</i>&mdash;but 'tis not the wine for great
company.  Now, my dear friends," said O'Hara,
stirring his new brew with the touch of a past
master, "if you want to know a wine that
combines the fire of the Madeira with the
elegance of the Claret, the power and mellowness
of the Port with the exhilaration of the
Champagne&mdash;there's nothing in the world can
compare to a fine screeching bowl of Brandy
Punch!"

<h3>
SCENE XXIV
</h3>

<p>
When Mistress Kitty had sipped half a glass
with great show of relish and rakishness, and
Lady Standish, under protest, had sucked a
few spoonfuls; when Lady Maria, stuck in
the middle of her fourth helping, protested
that she really could not finish the tumbler
and forthwith began to show signs of
incoherence and somnolence; when O'Hara broke
into snatches of song, and Lord Verney began
to make calf's eyes afresh at the lost Mistress
Kitty; when Sir Jasper, hanging round his
wife's chair, showed unequivocal signs of
repentance and a longing for reconciliation: when
Stafford himself became more pointed in his
admiration of Mistress Kitty and a trifle
broader in his jests than was quite consistent
with his usual breeding, the little widow
deemed it, at last, time to break up the
party.
</p>

<p>
There was a vast bustle, a prodigious
ordering and counter-ordering.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind me," whispered Stafford, ever
full of good humour and tact, into Sir Jasper's
ear, "take your wife home, man, I'll sleep
here if needs be."
</p>

<p>
"Not a foot," asserted O'Hara, apparently
quite sober, and speaking with the most
pleasant deliberation in the world, "not a
foot will I stir from this place, so long as
there is a lemon left."
</p>

<p>
"The cursed scoundrel," cried Lord Verney,
babbling with fury as he returned from the
stables, "the scoundrel, Spicer, has driven
off with my curricle!"
</p>

<p>
"Then shall we be a merry trio to drink
daylight in," said Stafford, and cheered.
</p>

<p>
"Come, <i>dear</i> Lady Maria," said Kitty.  "I
shall take care of you.  I will give you a seat
in my chaise; we shall drive home together."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my dear, certainly," mumbled
the Dowager.  "Who is that remarkably
agreeable person?" she requested to know of
Stafford in her prodigiously audible whisper.
"My dear," she turned again to Kitty, "I like
you wonderfully.  I cannot quite remember
your name, my dear, but we will go home
together."
</p>

<p>
"Dear, <i>dear</i> Lady Maria!" cried Mistress
Kitty, honey sweet.  "My Lord Verney, give
your arm to your revered relative&mdash;mind you
lead her carefully," she said, with all the imps
in her eyes dancing, "for I fear Mr. Stafford's
cordial has proved a little staggering&mdash;<i>after
the night air</i>!  And warn her ladyship's
attendant to be ready to escort us back in
my carriage."
</p>

<p>
Then, taking advantage of Sir Jasper's
absence&mdash;that gentleman might even then be
heard cursing his sleepy servants in the
yard&mdash;Mistress Kitty ran over to Lady Standish,
who stood wistful and apart at the inglenook.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she murmured, "the game is
now in your hands."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no!" returned the other.  "Oh, Kitty,
you have been an evil counsellor!"
</p>

<p>
"Is this your gratitude?" retorted Kitty,
and pinched her friend with vicious little
fingers.  "Why, woman, your husband never
thought so much of you in his life as he
does to-day!  Why, there has never been so
much fuss made over you since you were
born.  Are these your thanks?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for the moment when I can fly to
his bosom and tell him all!  My foolish
endeavour to make him jealous, my sinful
pretence that he had a rival in my heart!"
</p>

<p>
"What?" exclaimed the widow, and her
whisper took all the emphasis of a shriek.
"Fly to his bosom?  Then I have done
with you!  Bring him to his knees you
mean, madam.  Tell him all?  Tell him all,
forsooth, let him know you have made a fool
of him, all for nothing; let him think that
you had never had an idea beyond pining
for his love; that no other man ever thought
of you, that he has never had a rival, never
will have one, that you are merely his
own uninteresting Julia whom nobody wants.
Why, Lady Standish, 'tis laying down the
arms when the battle is yours.  Sheer insanity!
Prodigious, prodigious!" cried Mistress
Kitty.  "Is it possible that you and I are
of the same sex?"
</p>

<p>
Bewildered, yet half convinced, Lady Standish
listened and wondered.
</p>

<p>
"Be guided by me," whispered Kitty again.
"Indeed, my dear, I mean well by you.
Keep your secret if you love your husband.
Keep it more preciously than you would
keep jour youth and your beauty; for I tell
you 'tis now your most valuable possession.
Here," said she, and took a letter from her
famous bag and thrust it into Julia's hands,
"here is what will bring him to his knees!
Oh, what a game you have upon this drive
home if you know how to play it!"
</p>

<p>
"What is this, now?" cried Lady Standish.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" ordered Kitty, and clapped her
friend's hand over the letter.  "Promise,
promise!  Here comes your lord!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper had approached them as she
spoke; he now bowed confusedly and took
his wife's hand.  But:
</p>

<p>
"A word in your ear," said Mistress Kitty,
arresting him as they were about to pass out.
"A word in your ear, sir.  If a man has a
treasure at home he would keep for himself,
he will do well to guard it!  An unwatched
jewel, my good sir, invites thieves.  Good-night!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
And now in the great room of the <i>Bear Inn</i>
were left only three: the two gallant gentlemen,
O'Hara and Stafford, and Mistress Kitty.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Kitty's game had been successfully
played out; and yet the lady lingered.
</p>

<p>
"Good night," she began, then shot a
glance at Stafford.  "I wonder," she said
innocently, "if my carriage be ready, and
whether Lady Maria is well installed?"
</p>

<p>
"I will see," said Stafford simply, and
vanished.
</p>

<p>
O'Hara stood by the table, slowly dipping
the ladle into the punch and absently pouring
the liquor back into the bowl again.  She
sidled round to him.
</p>

<p>
"Denis!" said she.
</p>

<p>
He turned his wildly-bright eyes upon her,
but made no answer.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going back," said she, and held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
He carefully put down the ladle, took the
tips of her little fingers and kissed them.
But his hands and his lips were cold.
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to God," said he, "it's a grand
game you played with me ... the Bath
Comedy entirely, Kitty."
</p>

<p>
Then he dropped her hand and took up
the punch-ladle again with downcast looks.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not give me your arm to my
carriage?" said she, after a slight pause.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Kitty, sure haven't you broke my
heart for me ... and has not the punch
robbed me of my legs!"
</p>

<p>
His wild bright eyes were deeply sad as
he turned them on her, and he was pale as
death.
</p>

<p>
She drew back quickly, frowned, hesitated,
frowned again, and then brightened up once
more.
</p>

<p>
"Then, sir," said she, "when your legs are
restored to you, pray let them conduct your
heart round to my lodgings, and we shall see
what can be done towards mending it."
</p>

<p>
She dropped him a curtsey and was gone.
</p>

<p>
As Stafford folded her into the chaise, he
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"If ever <i>I</i> have a chance of running away
with you, Kitty, I'll take very good care
not to let you know which road I mean to
choose!"
</p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
SCENE XXV
</h3>

<p>
As the carriage rolled homewards on the
Bath Road, Lady Standish, both hands folded
over the mysterious letter, sat staring out of
the window with unseeing eyes.  The dawn
had begun to break upon a cloudless sky;
the air was chill and brisk; mists wreathed
white scarves over the fields.  She felt
conscious in every fibre of her being that Sir
Jasper was eagerly contemplating her in the
cold grey light.  Heart and brain were in a
turmoil; the anguish, the violent emotions,
the successive scenes of the last forty-eight
hours passed again before her mind like a
phantasmagoria.  Partly because of Mistress
Bellairs's advice and partly because of a
certain womanly resentment, which, gentle as
she was, still reared itself within her, she
did not even cast a look upon her husband,
but sat mutely, gazing at the land.  Presently
she became aware that he had slid an arm
behind her waist.  She trembled a little, but
did not turn to him.
</p>

<p>
"Julia," said he, in a muffled uncertain
tone, "Julia, I&mdash;I have done you injustice."  Then,
for jealousy is as ill to extinguish as
a fire that smoulders, a flame of the evil
passion leaped up again with him.  "But
you must admit," said he, "that I had cause.
Your own words, I may say your own confession&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish turned her head, lifted heavy
lids and for a moment fixed upon him the
most beautiful eyes in the world.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said she, "I made no confession."  Her
tongue trembled upon other protestations,
yet Kitty's warning carried the day.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said he, and bent to her, "tell
me was it Lord Verney after all?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Standish again raised her eyes to
his face, and could such a thing have been
possible in a creature whose very being was
all tenderness, he would have sworn that in
her gaze there was contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jasper," said she, "it never was Lord
Verney!"  And then she added: "Has there
not been enough of this?"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke she moved her hands and
involuntarily looked down at the letter she
held.  Then she sat as if turned to stone.
The letter was in Sir Jasper's writing and
addressed to Mistress Bellairs!
</p>

<p>
"What have you there?" cried he.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said she, "I know not, for 'tis not
my letter.  But you will know."  And she held
it up to him, and her hand did not tremble,
yet was a cold fear upon her.  "You wrote
it," she said.  He stared and his countenance
changed, utter discomposure fell upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Julia," cried he, "Julia, upon my honour!
I swear 'twas nothing, less than nothing, a
mere idle bit of gallantry&mdash;a jest!"  As he
spoke he fell upon one knee in the chaise,
at her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Then I may read it?" said she.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Julia!" cried he, and encircled her
with his arms.  She felt the straining
eagerness of his grasp, she felt his heart beat
stormily.  With a sudden warmth she knew
that after all his love was hers.
</p>

<p>
Then she had an inspiration, one worthy of a
cleverer woman: but love has his own geniuses.
She disengaged herself from his embrace and
put the letter into his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Take it," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Julia," he cried, and shook from head to
foot, and the tears sprang to his eyes, "I
never gave her a serious thought.  I vow I
hate the woman."
</p>

<p>
"Then tear it up," said Lady Standish,
with a superhuman magnanimity that almost
turned her faint.
</p>

<p>
He rose and tore the letter in shreds
(quickly, lest she should repent) and flung
them out of the window.  She watched the
floating pieces flutter and vanish.  In her
secret soul she said to herself:
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Bellairs and I shall be very good
friends at a distance!"
</p>

<p>
Her husband was kneeling at her feet again.
"Angel," cried he pleadingly, and once
more she was in his arms; and yet his
jealous heart kept growling within him, like a
surly dog that will not be silenced.  "Julia,"
said he in her ear, "but one word, one word,
my love!  Julia, is there anyone, anything
between us?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that," she said, and smiled archly,
"that, sir, you must discover for yourself."  Her
head sank on his shoulder as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You torture me!" he murmured.  But
she knew that he had never kissed her with
such passion in all his life before.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
As her chaise followed on the road, some
hundred yards or so behind Sir Jasper's,
Mistress Bellairs, sitting beside Lady Maria
(who snored the whole way with rhythmic
steadiness) gazed across the livid fields
towards the low horizon where the slow fires
of dawn were pulsing into brightness.  She
was in deeply reflective mood.
</p>

<p>
In her excited, busy brain she revolved
many important questions and weighed the
gains and losses in her game of "Love and
Hazard" with all the seriousness of the
gambler homeward bound after a heavy night.
</p>

<p>
"At least," she thought, with a little sigh, but
with some complacency, "I did a vastly good
turn to my Lady Standish.  But the woman
is a fool, if a sweet one, and fools are past
permanent mending.  I did well," thought
she, "to condemn the Calf&mdash;there is no
doubt of that."  She glanced at Lady Maria's
withered countenance, unlovely and undignified
in her stupor&mdash;&mdash;  "The menagerie would
have been the death of me, promptly....
But, my poor O'Hara!  How could I ever
have called him a cucumber?  <i>There</i> was
love for the taking, now&mdash;yet no!  Worshipper,
vastly well; but husband? not for
me, not for me!  Bless me," she cried to
herself testily; "is a woman to have no
choice between mid-winter, green spring, or
the dog days?  If I ever allow myself to
be abducted again, 'twill be with your Man
of the World&mdash;one with palate enough to
<i>relish me</i> without wanting to swallow me at
a gulp."
</p>

<p>
She paused in her train of thought to laugh
at the recollection of Mr. Stafford's parting
speech.  "There is an easy heart for you!"
she murmured.  "A gallant gentleman, with
as pretty a wit as O'Hara himself, and every
whit as good a leg.  Perhaps," thought
Mistress Kitty, yawned and grew sleepy;
nodded her delicate head; dreamed then a
little dream and saw a silver Beau in the
moonlight, and woke up with a smile.  The
spires of Bath Cathedral pierced silver grey
through a golden mist; far beneath her gaze,
as the chaise began to tip the crest of the
great hill, like a silver ribbon ran the river.
"Perhaps....  We shall see," said the widow.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
